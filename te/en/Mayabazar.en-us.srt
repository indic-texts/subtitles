52
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:20,789
Well, can you aim an arrow
as skillfully as I do?

00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:23,877
Show it by shooting.
I'll shoot better than you.

Give it to me.

00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:30,662
Aunt, can you shoot as

00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,129
Why not? Come with me.

57
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,822
I'll show my skill before your mother.

58
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:36,000

When she is standing by
holding bow and arrow,

64
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:53,982

What is it, sister-in-law?

67

Did you see what your son is up to?

00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:02,761
Sasi is standing with a fruit on
her head and he's aiming to hit it.

69
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,034
What would happen if arrow hits her?

70
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,026
You fear is unwarranted,
my son will never miss his target.

71
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,453
Aunt, stand without getting scared,

72
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:12,431
I'll hit your nose pin...

73
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:13,839
-...without hurting your nose.
-What?

74
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,270
Well said, my nephew.

75
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,027
Krishna, I'm telling now,

76
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:23,403
The strength of all the five Pandavas
is equal to my nephew's strength.

77
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,640
Remember that.

Subhadra

79
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:30,869
Ask what boon will brother grant
for giving birth to such a brave son.

80
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,256
Make your wish, Subhadra.
Whatever it is, I'll grant it.

81
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,528
Let Sasi become my daughter-in-law,
what else can I seek from you, brother?

82
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,435
Is it any wish, Subhadra?

83
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,850
We decided she'd your
daughter-in-law the moment she was born.

84
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,708
-What do you say Rukmini?
-Yes.

85
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:51,811
-Subhadra, are you still doubting them?
-Still having doubt?

86
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,205
Here... Sasi is your daughter-in-law.
Is it okay?

88
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,439

00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:20,760
Subhadra,

90
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:26,175
Give my special regards to Dharmaraja,
Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva,

91
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:31,174
and their mother Kunti Devi, and Draupadi.

92
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:37,542
Go carefully, Subhadra.

93
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:41,898
You might forget us due to getting carried
away in that glory after reaching there.

94
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,934
You've said it with a smile.
Such words really hurt, sister-in-law.

95
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:46,576
Forget it.

96
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,936
Why don't you stay with us, nephew?

97
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,500
No, I'll not stay.
I'm taking Sasi with me.

98
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:57,070
Good, like father like son.

99
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:58,707
Yes... Yes.

00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,847
Yeah, good! Come dear.

101
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,222
No. I'll go with him.

102
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:05,425
Let her come with us, sister-in-law.

103
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,463
You asked casually today,

104
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:10,356
But when that day comes,
you'll ask sternly

105
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:11,758
and we can't avoid sending her.

106
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,648
Well, let my daughter stay
with me till then at least.

107
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:16,557
-Come dear.
-No.

108
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,301
Satyaki, get her down.

109
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,575
-You can go later. Come down dear.
-No

110
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,413
We will come back again.
Come, get down.

111
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,045

Will you give it without telling her?

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,925
Everything would be known.

170

open this box privately.

himself lives in that kingdom.

Rukmini, if my brother
Krishna wasn't with them,

177
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:10,039
neither Indra's son nor
Indra himself could do anything.

178
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:13,701
He made Dharamaraja to finish
the Rajasuya Yagna successfully.

179
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,323
He received the highest
honour in that great assembly,

180
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,588
and destroyed evil by beheading
Shishupala who spread hate.

181
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:24,489
Krishna, it is me who
should felicitate you.

182
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,008
Come here.

183
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:29,744

"Is it you who called me?"

188
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:11,939
"Is it you who resides in
my heart and agitated it?"

seems as if it is a dream"

I'm unable to understand"

"whether it is a dream or
the magic of Lord Vishnu"

"It is you"

217
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,013
It is the gift sent by
Abhimanyu. Did you like it, Sasi?

218
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:25,601
Why are you feeling very shy?
It was Abhimanyu you saw, right.

219
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:27,912
Did she see him?

220
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:32,809
Our daughter saw Abhimanyu.
It's really effective.

221
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:33,937
You too open and see it.

222
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:36,566
You're very excited.
You open it first.

223
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,218
Open it, sister. Come on

224
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,580
Wow! Diamonds...

225
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:53,775
Jewels, silks!

226
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:01,094
It seems like Goddess of Wealth is
everywhere. What is this?

227
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,375
What could it be?
Wealth is very dear to you. That's it.

228
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,396
I don't have any such desires,
don't know why it appeared.

229
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,381
It doesn't show anything simply, sister.

230
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:13,432
I think it is your desire because
you're standing close to me.

231
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:14,170
May be.

232
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:15,334
[chuckles]

233
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:18,452
But you won't accept the its outcome.

234
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:19,272
Try your turn.

235
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:21,977
I'll accept if it shows what you desire.

236
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:24,759
Okay, I'll do it for you.

237
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:39,680
What! Why did Duryodhana
appear? It is strange.

238
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:40,724
What's strange in it?

239
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:44,606
It is known to everyone that
Duryodhana is my favourite disciple.

240
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:49,077
Krishna, it's your turn.
Let's see who appears.

241
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:52,710
It is obvious that Arjuna would appear.

242
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:54,498
Do we've to see it, brother?

243
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:57,999
Rukmini won't mind.
So, look at it Krishna.

244
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:01,930
Okay. Whoever appears to
me, don't get freezed.

245
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,836
Because I really don't
know whom I like or hate.

246
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:13,164
[laughs]

247
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,586
What! Shakuni appeared
inviting for a game of dice.

248
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:26,057
Will great men appear
for nothing, brother.

249
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:28,731
Don't know what game he's planning?

250
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:34,128
Great humiliation! Brutal cheating!

251
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:38,588
Dharmaraja conducted the
Rajasuya Yagna to humiliate me.

252
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:41,843
He built Mayasabha palace to undermine me.

253
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,039
Vassal kings bowed
before him instead of me,

254
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,120
and presented him with gifts and tax.

255
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:53,924
And I myself distributed those gems
studded hampers to them and became a barl.

256
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:58,855
Above all, I was laughed
at by imperious Draupadi.

257
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:04,088
Before that humiliation burns me,
I'll sacrifice my life to fire.

258
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:05,858
Arrange the pyre.

259
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:09,737
O emperor! Why are you worried
when your friend Karna is here?

260
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,035
Blow the trumpets of war.

261
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:13,485
I'll kill Pandavas and repay my gratitude.

262
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:15,924
Well said Karna.
That's our immediate duty.

263
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:20,588
Duryodhana, why use an axe for
something that can be clipped with a nail?

264
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:22,864
Invite Dharmaraja for the game of dice.

265
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:24,815
I'll simply play the game,

266
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:30,552
effortlessly win their
kingdom and present it to you.

267
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:33,821
Winning and losing in game
of dice is decided by God, Uncle.

268
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,163
What if we lose?

269
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:37,081
May this inauspicious
words never come true.

270
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:41,393
My dice will never lose.
Test it. Come on.

271
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:43,873
Dushasana, tell me your number.

272
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:46,091
Two!

273
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:51,357
Wow uncle!
This is our immediate duty.

274
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:53,616
Karna, you tell now.

275
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:57,618
It's not heroic to hide our
strength and use contrivance.

276
00:23:58,223 --> 00:24:01,311
No problem, Warrior Karna. Test my skill.

277
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,046
Two again.

278
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:05,661
Wow uncle!

279
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:08,822
Did you see Duryodhana?

280
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:11,690
An idea in the brain and dice in hands,

281
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,440
With them I can bring
a complete destruction.

282
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:16,440
You test me too.

283
00:24:17,785 --> 00:24:21,971
-Third time is very important.
-Okay, I'll see. Same two.

284
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,756
No, wait. One!

285
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:26,659
Wow uncle!

286
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:31,151
Did you see? The dice fell one
hesitantly when you asked hesitantly.

287
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,873
-Invite Dharmaraja immediately.
-Yes brother.

288
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,269
That's our immediate duty.

289
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,310
Duryodhana, one more thing,

290
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:46,507
Dharmaraja is impulsive gambler,
he goes berserk on losing,

291
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,285
you make him stake not just
kingdom but his brothers,

292
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:55,457
himself and their wife
Draupadi too and lose them.

293
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:57,403
Now, it's your wish.

294
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:00,633
I hope you'll achieve
what you said, uncle.

295
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:04,182
Brother, uncle's idea is a cyclone.
A great cyclone!

296
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:10,329
[earthquake]

297
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,936
What's this bad omen, uncle?

298
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:26,045
Bad omen at Shakuni's place? No way!

299
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,661
This is a victory anthem for my plans.

300
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:29,873
Don't get scared.

301
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:31,653
Let all your fears vanish.

302
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:33,470
Even Lord Krishna,

303
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,860
who is biased in favour of the Pandavas
would understand the power of my dice.

304
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:37,579
Let's go.

305
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,403
[music]

306
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,266
"Did you hear this, Yashoda?"

307
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,305
"Did you hear this, Yashoda?"

308
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:07,480
"Did you hear about pranks of
your little mischief Krishna?"

309
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:17,960
"I don't know anything,
I wasn't here at all"

310
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:26,192
"What can we do about his behaviour?"

311
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,192
Is he the one who eats butter or mud?

312
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:33,148
"By supressing the sound of his anklets,
he enters house stealthily like a cat"

313
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:40,218
"By supressing the sound of his anklets,
he enters house stealthily like a cat"

314
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,795
"He brings down the pots
that are tied to the ceiling"

315
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:49,455
"He brings down the pots
that are tied to the ceiling"

316
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:51,618
"And drank all the milk"

317
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:54,025
"Ate all the curd"

318
00:26:54,984 --> 00:26:56,485
"Swallowed all the butter"

319
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,627
"How can I single handedly eat them?
Does it happen anywhere?"

320
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:04,371
"Does it happen anywhere?"

321
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:09,241
"Did you hear it, mother Yashoda?"

322
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:14,004
"Did you hear the fabricated
stories of Gopikas?"

323
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:18,335
What? See how he is blaming us.
Can he be caught even if we want to?

324
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:23,772
"When all the ladies set a plan and
were waiting at every threshold"

"When all the ladies set a plan and
were waiting at every threshold"

326
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:34,506
"Anklet clinking was heard in one's home"

327
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,857
"Flute was being played in another's home"

328

"Anklet clinking was heard in one's home"

329
00:27:47,827 --> 00:27:50,422
"Flute was being played in another's home"

330
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:51,815
"Aha! Then, what?"

331
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:54,438
"When we went inside to
check who the thief was"

332
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:57,316
"He jumped off from there magically"

333

he entered and escaped?"

he entered and escaped?"

335

"How would I know? I wasn't there"

336
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:12,560
"Where were you then?"

337
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:17,546
"Danced on the head of the snake, Kaliya
snake that poisoned the river Kalindi"

338
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:31,592
"Danced on the head of the snake, Kaliya
snake that poisoned the river Kalindi"

-"I killed the snake and reared cattle"-Hey Krishna!

342
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:48,620
Hey Krishna... Mukunda...

343
00:28:49,315 --> 00:28:52,548
Won't you hear my appeal for help?

344
00:28:58,658 --> 00:29:04,676
"I don't have any other saviour than you"

Hey Krishna,"

00:29:12,656 --> 00:29:16,770
"Won't you see my pathetic condition?"

347
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:19,553
-"Please listen..."
-Krishna! What is this?

348
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,163
What's this?
What happened?

349
00:29:24,453 --> 00:29:27,733
What would it be?
There is no bound for Kauravas atrocities.

350
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,751
Not only did they take away Pandavas
kingdom in their hexed game of dice,

351
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:36,845
but also they've humiliated them
and and were sending them to exile.

352
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:39,009
What! Such an injustice?

353
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,478
-So evil minded!
-It is the egoistic pride of the Kauravas.

354
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:43,767
We shouldn't tolerate this injustice!

355
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:46,127
Brother, give an order.

356
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,114
-I'll go with our army...
-Satyaki,

357
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,582
Don't rush off.

358
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,511
I too won't tolerate injustice.

359
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:55,033
Now, I'll go to Hastinapura and
teach a lesson to Kauravas,

360
00:29:55,242 --> 00:29:56,930
and return the lost kingdom to Pandavas.

361
00:29:57,892 --> 00:30:00,939
Duryodhana is my disciple,
he'll never go against me.

362
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,573
Get my chariot ready.

363
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:04,687
Come dear.

364
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,552
I've been fearing about
trickster, Shakuni's evil plans.

365
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:10,542
No matter whatever someone does, it is
we who have to face the consequences.

366
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:17,913
Don't worry Sasi.
I'm there for them.

367
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:19,203
Hail King!

368
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,943
We've received a message about your
Guru Balarama visiting our kingdom.

369
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:29,442
Sentry, take this for
bringing good news on time.

370
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:34,229
How is it good news, Uncle? I'm scared.

371
00:30:34,677 --> 00:30:38,003
We don't know the reason of his visit.
Moreover, he's short tempered.

372
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,465
No problem, Duryodhana.

373
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,799
Best remedy for short temper is praise.

374
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:45,375
So arrange a grand
honour to Lord Balarama.

375
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,240
He will be pleased with your felicitation,

376
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:50,465
and grant you a boon without
even having a second thought.

377
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:51,512
Take it.

378
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:58,929
Get your son Lakshmana Kumar
married with his daughter Sasirekha.

379
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:01,470
With that, Balarama will be on our side.

380
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,520
Ultimately, Yadavas will be on our side.

381
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:08,341
And with that, Krishna will be left
with no choice but to join our ranks.

382
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:10,688
Wow Uncle!
That's our immediate duty.

383
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:13,968
Uncle, politically our plan is flawless,

384
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:17,205
but our Lakshmana Kumar
is more proud than his father.

385
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:19,809
Will he accept the Yadava princess?

386
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:23,473
Well, he will definitely accept.
That's my responsibility.

387
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:31,083
[humming]

388
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:37,062
-Sarathy
-My lord.

389
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:38,024
[whistles]

390
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:40,696
Wow! Amazing!

391
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:46,043
-My lord!
-Yes.

392
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:53,101
Great warrior, braveheart,
Lakshmana Kumar...

393
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,610
-Enough of your praise.
-Okay.

394
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,377
My lord, hear mine.

395
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:02,772
You're life is honourable than Abhimanyu's

396
00:32:02,864 --> 00:32:04,254
Wow! This is real poetry.

397
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:05,091
Here, take it.

398
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:07,502
Then, hear this.

399
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:10,150
"Being exiled into a
forest is his ill-fate,"

400
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,850
"Having lavish life is your good fate."

401
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:14,816
Well said.

402
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:16,723
Hail prince!

403
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:22,060
-My lord, you've got visitor.
-Not now.

404
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:26,984
"In the battlefield, when a
Padmavyuha (Lotus strategy) is planned,"

405
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,199
"Abhimanyu knows only to go forward,"

406
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,092
"But you know how to turn back."

407
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:32,137
[laughs]

408
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:32,951
-My lord!
-Shh!

409
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,313
"Has he got your brain?"

410
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:37,017
"Has he got your ease?"

411
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:38,642
"Has he got your mastery of art?"

412
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:41,594
-"This is not a praise"
-Ha ha.

413
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:42,823
Sarathy... Sarathy.

414
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:46,929
My lord, they've praised
and accepted gifts.

415
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:50,365
These blabbering poets are
nothing compared to me.

416
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:52,113
-Hear mine.
-Yes.

417
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:53,963
"Two that side, two this side,"

418
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:55,988
"Abhimanyu's uncles"

419
00:32:56,523 --> 00:33:00,701
"From either side,
they are just four."

420
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,533
"But for you,"

421
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:06,993
"You've got one less of hundred uncles."

422
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:11,671
What an army of uncles you have!

423
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:16,507
-"Wonderful..."
-Well said, Sarathy.

424
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:19,472
Dear Lakshmana Kumara!

425
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,557
Oh is it you?
You all may leave now.

426
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:31,323
Wow! You look very handsome.
A romantic hero indeed.

427
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:35,095
I'll tell you good news,
come sit here.

428
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,872
It is the attribute of a brave
person to listen standing.

429
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:38,959
Tell me.

430
00:33:39,557 --> 00:33:42,986
Look, you're the prince
of this vast kingdom.

431
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:44,289
That's all?

432
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,830
Not just that,
you're the prince of princes.

433
00:33:48,154 --> 00:33:49,475
Young king!

434
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,055
Young emperor!

435
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:57,032
Your father and I've decided
that we should get you married.

436
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:58,358
Then, I've decided too.

437
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,667
The proposal is also
from a very good family.

438
00:34:02,195 --> 00:34:03,998
The bride is a world beauty.

439
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:07,149
Sasirekha, Balarama's daughter.

440
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:07,875
What a shame!

441
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:11,631
How can I become the son-in-law to
uncivilised liege king of Yadavas?

442
00:34:11,938 --> 00:34:12,544
Impossible.

443
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,265
That's a danger.

444
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:17,866
We've heard that Abhimanyu loves her.

445
00:34:18,094 --> 00:34:20,412
What!
Is it me who can't love her?

446
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:22,936
I'll marry any girl Abhimanyu loves.

447
00:34:23,256 --> 00:34:25,061
I'll ensure that there are no girls
left in this world for him to marry.

448
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,745
Grandpa, I want Rekha.

449
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:30,168
-You're smart!
-Yes.

450
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,767
-Then I'll fix the marriage.
-Your wish.

451
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:48,495
Hail victory to you!

452
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,014
Epitome of truth!

453
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,268
Protector of the refuge seekers!

454
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:52,836
Generous man!

455
00:34:52,937 --> 00:34:54,378
Saviour of the world!

456
00:34:54,603 --> 00:34:58,330
Supreme lord of the world,
Sri Sri Balarama!

457
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,703
Hail victory to you!

458
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:06,912
[music]

459
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,061
Has he got your brain?

460
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:54,420
Has he got your ease?

461
00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:57,281
Has he got your mastery of art?

462
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:00,151
-Who is it, Sarathy?
-You!

463
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:02,712
No... I mean Abhimanyu.

464
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,915
"Victory to you, O mighty warrior!"

465
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,530
"Victory to you, O romantic hero!"

466
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:12,251
"Lullaby." Stop your lullaby!

467
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:13,007
Okay.

468
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:17,970
My lord, come quickly and
seek blessings from Balarama.

469
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:20,263
Shame! Taking is seeker's trait.

470
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:22,512
-Giving is regal character.
-So be it!

471
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:27,065
My lord, if you delay like this,
you may not get Sasirekha.

472
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:30,551
You promised to bow to
your future father-in-law.

473
00:37:30,644 --> 00:37:33,285
Not bow, I promised only to greet him.

474
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:36,397
-How to do it?
-It's simple, my lord.

475
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:39,686
-Fold hands like this...
-Shame! That's your habit.

476
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,237
So be it.

477
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:42,573
My lord, I'll show you.

478
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:45,096
You've seen Dharmaraja

479
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,696
greeting Bhishma, Dronacharya
and your grandfather, didn't you?

480
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:50,244
And you used to laugh jeeringly at him.

481
00:37:50,763 --> 00:37:53,260
Even though it is little
difficult, bend like this

482
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:55,382
with profound humbleness,

483
00:37:55,609 --> 00:38:00,875
-Bend like this... and that's all, my lord
-I can go down further, get up.

484
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:02,129
Come.

485
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:09,782
Moreover, the game of dice was played with
Bheeshma, Drona, Vidhura's permission

486
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,409
and in their presence.

487
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:15,659
If there was injustice
would they keep quiet?

488
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:20,658
Yes, winning fairly in the game of
dice is equal as just as winning a war.

489
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,960
I too accept it.

490
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:25,561
Not only you, even Dharmaraja
himself accepted it.

491
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:30,142
But Bhima got furious and
made vows of destruction.

492
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:35,325
Uncle, don't talk about that
blabber and hurt his feelings.

493
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:38,035
Let him tell, shamelessly made vows too.

494
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,023
-What did he say?
-To kill everyone.

495
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:44,359
He promised to split open my chest.

496
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,689
-He promised to drink my blood.
-What did l do?

497
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:48,395
Brother's order and my duty
to follow it.

498
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:52,136
-And Draupadi...
-Not just her relatives,

499
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,291
He was ranting that the world is on
his side and Kauravas fall is inevitable.

500
00:38:58,492 --> 00:38:59,798
So I couldn't bear to hear it and said,

501
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:03,780
"Mighty warrior Balarama is on our side."

502
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:08,293
Then he said, "I'll break Duryodhana's
thigh as Balarama watches",

503
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:10,179
"what can that old man do,"

504
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:11,695
-"what can that Yadava do..."
-Aargh!

505
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:15,619
He's a rogue!
He's responsible for this enmity.

506
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:19,269
-It's not a sin to kill him.
-Calm down.

507
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:22,022
You're an elderly person,

508
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:23,677
who wishes for welfare of everyone,

509
00:39:27,553 --> 00:39:30,542
I told you to relieve
my burden of my fear but

510
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:34,946
Guru, I don't want all
these fears and jealous,

511
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:40,524
I'll give you the entire kingdom
that I won in the game of dice.

512
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:45,376
Return the kingdom to them
and bring peace between us.

513
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:48,468
Unnecessary. It is sin to give
to those who don't deserve it.

514
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:53,348
Duryodhana, I'm granting you a
boon pleased with your conduct.

515
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:54,647
Make your wish.

516
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:58,062
Lakshmana Kumara,
you came at the right time.

517
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:58,962
Come son!

518
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:07,741
Touch Guru's feet and seek his blessings.

519
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:12,821
May you get married soon!

520
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:16,484
Duryodhana, your son is
ahead of you in humbleness.

521
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,171
He respects elders.

522
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:20,053
Never raises head also
before his father.

523
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:22,216
He has great devotion for you.

524
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:26,990
Those are the traits of a great people.
That will bring laurels to future kings.

525
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:28,388
Get up son!

526
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:31,008
What do you want?

527
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,675
He has been yearning for many years,

528
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:37,308
She's doing penance to make
your daughter Sasi his queen.

529
00:40:37,942 --> 00:40:41,342
-You have to fulfil his wish.
-Happily granted.

530
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:43,018
Get up son.

531
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,770
Hail Lord Krishna!

532
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:53,541
Hail Subhadra Devi! Hail Abhimanyu!

533
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:00,128
Welcome Subhadra.

534
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:05,688
May you be blessed with marriage.

535
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:10,304
Are the Pandavas doing fine, brother?

536
00:41:11,248 --> 00:41:13,299
Great men are fine
wherever they are.

537
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:19,586
Are you fine, dear?

538
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:26,536
Sasi! Did you see he
has become Sathyavan?

539
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:35,262
If he's Sathyavan, then she's Savithri.

540
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:37,102
Our girl is no less.

541
00:41:38,357 --> 00:41:42,151
Rukmini, can't find
sister-in-law? Is she fine?

542
00:41:43,182 --> 00:41:44,713
She belongs to olden times,

543
00:41:44,986 --> 00:41:47,664
She's more sad than
Pandavas for losing kingdom.

544
00:41:47,735 --> 00:41:52,368
Yes. If we are happy, she
will be happy too. Come in.

545
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:54,048
Come nephew.

546
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:01,000
I felt very pity on
seeing Subhadra, madam.

547
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:03,287
No grandeur of old times.

548
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:07,605
She came wearing jute sari
without any jewels.

549
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:11,056
As you sow so you reap.

550
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:12,839
-What can we do?
-Queen,

551
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,780
Subhadra Devi is coming.

552
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:17,760
Okay.

553
00:42:18,044 --> 00:42:20,399
Champa, bandage my head.

554
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:33,225
[groaning]

555
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:36,058
Champa...

556
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:50,402
[groaning]

557
00:42:52,078 --> 00:42:53,411
Come Subhadra!

558
00:42:54,146 --> 00:42:55,311
Had a safe journey?

559
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,695
Please sit.

560
00:42:58,022 --> 00:43:01,807
My bad time, I got headache when you came.

561
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:03,952
I couldn't even come to receive you.

562
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:05,954
I wanted to meet you immediately,

563
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:08,591
But brother Krishna and Rukmini
took me to their house, sister-in-law.

564
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:09,995
I don't mind which ever house you go to.

565
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,738
I don't have any such botherings.

566
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:15,370
Henceforth, all of us
have to stay here, right?

567
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,820
These twelve years...

568
00:43:17,382 --> 00:43:19,520
Wherever we reside,
we don't lack any luxury.

569
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:21,208
You don't feel sad for it.

570
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,280
When is brother retuning?

571
00:43:23,845 --> 00:43:24,395
How do I know?

572
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:27,092
Did he inform me before
leaving to inform his arrival?

573
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:28,778
Moreover, he's a short tempered man.

574
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:32,781
I'm scared that he may
pick up a fight there.

575
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:34,181
Oh no!

576
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:39,506
Sister-in-law, you're worrying
too much. Take some rest.

577
00:43:40,422 --> 00:43:41,435
I'll come after brother arrives.

Madam, your mother wants
to see you immediately.

604
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:56,276
Sasi, tomorrow is full moon day.

605
00:46:56,592 --> 00:46:58,060
Don't forget about boating tour.

606
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,009
What's it mother?

607
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:14,767
Are you having headache?

608
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,204
Indeed your silly acts
are giving me headaches.

609
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:19,503
Why were you dancing around
with him in the garden?

610
00:47:20,324 --> 00:47:21,561
What's wrong if I play with him?

611
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,934
Are you both little children?

612
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:25,433
You're young woman
and of marriageable age,

613
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:27,541
won't others laugh at us if you
roam with him before marriage?

614
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:29,372
Won't the elders of the
place find fault with it?

615
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:30,579
It'll bring bad name too.

616
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:32,312
What do you want me to do then?

617
00:47:32,334 --> 00:47:35,210
I'm telling you to stop
going out with Abhimanyu.

618
00:47:35,596 --> 00:47:37,163
Infact, don't even talk to him.

619
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:40,099
Follow my orders and be
my daughter. Understood?

00:48:08,108 --> 00:48:10,342
Subhadra, what happened?

624
00:48:12,825 --> 00:48:16,586
They say never go to parents'
home after getting ruined.

625
00:48:17,716 --> 00:48:19,990
After seeing elder
sister-in-law's cold reception,

626
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:23,265
I'm rethinking of my arrival here.

627
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:25,067
What's this, Subhadra?

628
00:48:25,513 --> 00:48:27,880
How can you think like this
despite knowing about her attitude?

629
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,169
She'll change after Balarama returns.

630
00:48:31,653 --> 00:48:34,196
Come, your brother is waiting for you.

631
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:48,385
Wow! This one jewel will cost 10 lakhs.

632
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:50,872
If we have to value all these...

633
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:51,903
What's there in the value?

634
00:48:52,628 --> 00:48:55,269
This is Emperor
Duryodhana's devotion on me.

635
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,183
He gave me a rousing
reception and felicitated me.

636
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,223
I granted him a boon
pleased with his devotion.

637
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:03,834
What did he wish for?
What did you grant?

638
00:49:04,196 --> 00:49:05,442
Please tell me too.

639
00:49:05,832 --> 00:49:07,117
How can I not tell you?

640
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:09,716
He asked to make Queen Revathi's daughter,

641
00:49:10,021 --> 00:49:13,976
as the queen of future
king Lakshmana Kumara.

642
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:15,147
I said yes.

643
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:20,617
-But I'm worried about Subhadra.
-She might think anything.

644
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:22,981
Can we send our daughter
to forest for her sake?

645
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,303
As our daughter is really fortunate,

646
00:49:25,651 --> 00:49:27,315
they made a request and you promised them.

647
00:49:27,983 --> 00:49:29,574
And the burden on my heart has eased too.

648
00:49:30,493 --> 00:49:34,078
But let us keep this confidential
till the marriage date is fixed.

649
00:49:34,187 --> 00:49:35,511
-Why?
-You don't know anything,

650
00:49:35,882 --> 00:49:37,666
Subhadra will create a
scene if she comes to know.

651
00:49:38,005 --> 00:49:39,307
Oh! Alright.

652
00:49:40,205 --> 00:49:40,855
Come dear... come.

653
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:43,977
Come dear... come.

654
00:49:45,453 --> 00:49:48,463
Look, these gifts were
sent to you by Bhanumathi.

655
00:49:48,974 --> 00:49:51,430
-I don't want it, father.
-Don't say like that, accept it.

656
00:49:51,552 --> 00:49:53,633
Will you say no to gifts sent
by Queen Bhanumathi?

657
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:55,955
Who is she to send me gifts?

658
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:58,066
-Who am I to her to accept the gifts?
-Did you see her hot temper?

659
00:49:58,182 --> 00:50:00,552
What's this dear?
They are also our well wishers.

660
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:03,394
How can they be, father?
Anyway I'll not accept it.

661
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:06,021
-Sasi...
-You keep quiet, I'll cure that itch.

662
00:50:15,676 --> 00:50:19,004
What's your arrogance?
Will you walk out on your father?

663
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:23,748
When Kaurava King sends gifts
to honour you, will you belittle them?

664
00:50:24,308 --> 00:50:25,326
I didn't belittle them.

665
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:30,609
Those evil people sent gifts
to insult you, me and all of us.

666
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:33,521
What? Who taught all these bad ideas?

667
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,371
Rukmini and Subhadra?
I don't like all this.

668
00:50:36,582 --> 00:50:39,254
Don't ever go to their home
again, don't even talk to them.

669
00:50:39,468 --> 00:50:41,176
You're my daughter.

670
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:43,455
You must obey me. Be careful.

how should I come out?

Shh! Jump, I'll catch you.

679
00:52:02,204 --> 00:52:04,372
How am I to come up again?

680
00:52:08,976 --> 00:52:12,049

with arrows. Climb down.

Come.

What's these late night boat

Stop!
I'll get you gifts.

Praising me coming to my place.

746
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:26,575
Then what? You're the supreme lord!

747
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:29,936
Yes... but I didn't expect you so early.

748
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:31,184
Why should you think, brother?

749
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:34,270
You're kind hearted boon giver,
don't know what boon you granted them.

750
00:59:34,736 --> 00:59:37,364
May be he's here to remind
you, lest you may forget it.

751
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:39,344
Why should I remind him, Krishna?

752
00:59:39,558 --> 00:59:41,884
The moment he granted
the boon we were blessed.

753
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:44,339
Yes... Great men don't come for nothing.

754
00:59:44,717 --> 00:59:45,215
Brother...

755
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:48,951
Whatever it is, I'll not tolerate
if he plays game of dice with you.

756
00:59:49,612 --> 00:59:50,995
Why are you so scared, Krishna?

757
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,470
It is obvious that your
brother will win the game of dice.

758
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:55,982
He's epitome of honesty.

759
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:59,630
But if it is proved you're dishonest,
you'll have trouble from him.

760
01:00:01,213 --> 01:00:02,564
It's good for you to be careful.

761
01:00:03,123 --> 01:00:04,525
Though I'm younger it
just my sweet warning.

762
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:09,482
Did you see how Krishna is
threatening with his wit?

763
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:14,697
No, whenever he meets intelligent
men like you, he gets little shaken up.

764
01:00:15,547 --> 01:00:16,202
Welcome.

765
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,419
Welcome.

766
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:24,030
This auspicious time is fixed according
Lakshmana Kumar's horoscope.

767
01:00:24,768 --> 01:00:27,491
The event of wedding of Sasirekha

768
01:00:28,017 --> 01:00:29,950
will be an event that world will
remember for a very long time.

769
01:00:30,213 --> 01:00:33,512
The power of the
auspicious time is very strong.

770
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:36,392
You've decided the auspicious time too.

771
01:00:37,035 --> 01:00:39,841
Of course. As soon as you said okay,

772
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:44,229
Bheeshma, Drona and Vidhura
wanted this to happen at the earliest

773
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,512
So they've sent us by fixing
this date and time of marriage.

774
01:00:48,057 --> 01:00:52,096
If elders had fixed this, I'm
sure it'll be very important.

775
01:00:54,106 --> 01:00:56,306
Why are you thinking, brother? Go ahead.

776
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:57,098
So be it.

777
01:01:00,185 --> 01:01:03,063
I think our priests are checking
for the best auspicious dates.

778
01:01:03,461 --> 01:01:06,057
Wow! Great astrologers!

779
01:01:06,953 --> 01:01:10,798
They are very renowned astrologers.

780
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:16,463
There's nothing to think
about this auspicious time.

781
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:18,372
And even there is nothing
doubtful about this auspicious time.

782
01:01:18,628 --> 01:01:19,728
But still,

783
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:23,103
We're checking planetary movements
according to the bride's horoscope.

784
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:29,781
Shukracharya,
the guru of demons is casting a bad eye.

785
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:34,518
This may create problems and difficulties
in the lives of the newly weds.

786
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:40,745
Yes, astrology always says
right and bitter truths only.

787
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:44,187
We must take only
the gist of it lightly.

788
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:50,649
You've to take problem
here as love problem.

789
01:01:50,979 --> 01:01:56,030
Difficulties here mean many children.

790
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:59,346
But this is bad time.

791
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:03,179
Astrology says marriage
in these times is impossible.

792
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:07,257
You need to be presented
for your scholarliness.

793
01:02:07,868 --> 01:02:10,287
But your astrology works
for ordinary people only,

794
01:02:10,648 --> 01:02:13,951
not for Kauravas who are
brilliant and fortunate men.

795
01:02:14,262 --> 01:02:18,683
May be but when Saturn is in this room...

796
01:02:18,884 --> 01:02:19,654
[chuckles]

797
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:23,809
Our Shakuni who is equal
to a lakh Saturns is here,

798
01:02:23,897 --> 01:02:25,433
so why bother in which room the Saturn is?

799
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:28,585
Accept it. It's their tradition.

800
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,105
Brother, their haste is ours too.

801
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:37,421
I too agree for this proposal
and the time fixed by them.

802
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,882
Only if you think we don't
have much time.

803
01:02:40,847 --> 01:02:45,384
Krishna, when you're taking all
the responsibility in your hands,

804
01:02:46,582 --> 01:02:49,784
The time will never run short.
I don't have that fear.

805
01:02:50,563 --> 01:02:53,026
Alright. We shall fix
the wedding at this time.

806
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:11,686
Amazing!
Sasirekha madam is very fortunate.

807
01:03:12,374 --> 01:03:14,241
She's going to wed Prince,
Lakshmana Kumara

808
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:16,951
and become the daughter-in-law
of Queen Bhanumati...

809
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:18,620
-Champa
-Madam.

810
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:27,308
Be careful.
Mind your words. Get lost.

811

[metal vessel tumbles]

812
01:03:40,093 --> 01:03:41,480
What's this barlishness, Sasi?

813
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:45,751
How humiliated I would be if
people come to know your attitude?

814
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:52,329
I plead you. Get groomed and come now.

815
01:03:52,986 --> 01:03:54,705
Grandpa Shakuni will bless you.

816
01:03:54,923 --> 01:03:58,213
I don't want any blessings.
I'm not interested in this wedding at all.

817
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:01,266
Don't you say that. It is the
proposal which matches our status.

818
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,306
And it is the wealth which came for us.

819
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,256
Your dad gave his word to the
emperor for the welfare of you.

820
01:04:07,024 --> 01:04:08,015
Even your Uncle,
Krishna accepted this proposal.

821
01:04:08,716 --> 01:04:10,306
It is a lie. Everything is a lie.

822
01:04:10,485 --> 01:04:12,976
Your uncle himself sat with
them and approved the proposal.

823
01:04:13,602 --> 01:04:15,178
Let me ask him to say that to you.

824
01:04:15,431 --> 01:04:17,818
-I don't want anyone to tell me anything.
-My Queen

825
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:20,534
Subhadra and Rukhmini have arrived.

826
01:04:20,771 --> 01:04:22,362
Everyone was holding grudge on me.

827
01:04:22,816 --> 01:04:23,715
What sin did I commit?

828
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:30,487
Is it justice to break a promise of making
Sasi my daughter-in-law, brother?

829
01:04:30,677 --> 01:04:34,085
Is it breaking a promise?
He told it just like that to his sister.

830
01:04:34,594 --> 01:04:37,723
Will it be same as granting a boon
to emperor Duryodhana in his court?

831
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,399
Not only that, you're making a
wedding alliance with of our enemies.

832
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:44,416
Did you think it's a great insult to me?

833
01:04:45,395 --> 01:04:48,855
How my husband his
brothers look down upon me?

834
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,349
If you think there would be such
treatment, then don't go there at all.

835
01:04:52,298 --> 01:04:54,018
There's nothing short
in your respect here.

836
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:57,531
Enough of your respect for me, brother.
I'm telling you the last time,

837
01:04:58,224 --> 01:05:00,806
If Sasi doesn't become my daughter-in-law,
I'll not stay here even for a moment.

838
01:05:01,094 --> 01:05:02,398
Is this how you're going to threaten us?

839
01:05:02,923 --> 01:05:06,230
Do you want my daughter also
to be in parents' home like you?

840
01:05:07,992 --> 01:05:12,718
Sister, leave about Subhadra.
Think about our daughter.

841
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,408
It is we who filled her
thoughts since childhood.

842
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:19,250
Sasi hopes that Abhimanyu
will become her husband.

843
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:22,580
If you marry her to someone else,
what will become of her life?

844
01:05:22,683 --> 01:05:24,583
Do you know about a daughter more than me?

845
01:05:25,115 --> 01:05:26,501
You would know had you
given birth to a daughter.

846
01:05:26,629 --> 01:05:27,416
Would you say these morals then?

847
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,400
Revathi, keep quiet.

848
01:05:30,113 --> 01:05:33,637
Whatever it is, this wedding
would be conducted as scheduled.

849
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:36,311
I don't want anyone
to stop or threaten me.

850
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:37,946
Surely you do, brother.

851
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:40,721
You're ruining two young
people's lives cosnciously.

852
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,931
I didn't think you'll be so obstinate.

853
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:45,840
Making your sibling sad
wouldn't just go waste.

854
01:05:46,504 --> 01:05:50,236
May be you think wealth of Kauravas
is greater than courage of Pandavas.

855
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:51,237
It will never be true.

856
01:05:51,552 --> 01:05:54,031
Are you threatening me with
their bravery, Subhadra?

857
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:59,367
Their bravery doesn't need me,
my disciple Duryodhana is enough.

858
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,126
Even 1000 Bhimas and 1000 Arjunas
are nothing compared to him.

859
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:09,246
Uncle, mind your tongue.
Though my father is not present, I'm here.

860
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:12,109
-What will you do?
-What will I do?

861
01:06:12,327 --> 01:06:16,220
Abhimanyu, will you bring an insult
to me by going against your uncle?

862
01:06:16,602 --> 01:06:19,997
This is not a mutiny.
I'm standing bravely on my ground.

863
01:06:21,326 --> 01:06:24,572
Uncle, if Kauravas are
as brave as you say,

864
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:26,983
tell them to come along
with Lakshmana Kumara,

865
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:29,684
I'll drive out Duryodhana,
Dushyasana, Karna and Shakuni,

866
01:06:30,193 --> 01:06:33,348
and their armies to Hastinapuram,

867
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:36,016
I'll take Sasi as my wife
in open competition.

868
01:06:36,524 --> 01:06:39,172
If you and your friends have the courage,
announce a Swayamvara.

869
01:06:39,484 --> 01:06:41,043
You'll know who Sasi belongs to.

870
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:44,213
Abhimanyu,
why are you throwing challenges?

871
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,942
If you are really a brave man,

872
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:50,258
would you stand here and throw challenges?

873
01:06:57,689 --> 01:07:01,352
Subhadra, you're a brave
wife and a brave mother.

874
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:03,260
I didn't expect you to be so weak.

875
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:07,712
You understood Balarama's intentions,
right? Why do you still make a scene?

876
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:10,303
There is no one here to
to listen to your appeals.

877
01:07:11,397 --> 01:07:12,815
You can go wherever you feel like.

878
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,940
Sure, brother.

879
01:07:16,788 --> 01:07:21,221
The day when you honour
bravery but not wealth,

880
01:07:21,687 --> 01:07:23,359
I'll step here again only on that day.

881
01:07:25,293 --> 01:07:26,000
Aunt!

882
01:07:26,954 --> 01:07:29,101
-Aunt!
-Where are you going, Sasi?

883
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:32,263
-I'll also go with aunt.
-When I'm still alive?

884
01:07:32,542 --> 01:07:34,539
Don't get smart with me.
Come.

885
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,816
-Aunt.
-Sasi, what's this?

886
01:07:47,444 --> 01:07:48,020
Dharuka,

887
01:07:51,685 --> 01:07:54,144
Subhadra and Abhimanyu
are leaving to Dwaithavanam.

888
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:58,053
But you've to take them to Ghatotkacha's
ashram without informing them.

889
01:07:58,193 --> 01:07:58,695

This is right way.
We've entered it knowingly.

1007

What do you call their enemies Kauravas?

1033
01:17:56,448 --> 01:17:59,993
Anti frendz... Anti frendz.

1034
01:18:00,194 --> 01:18:01,842
You and your brain!

1035
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:05,209
My lord, he has produced a new
word foe as antonym of friend.

1036
01:18:05,459 --> 01:18:08,127
Yes, how words develop
without anyone producing it.

1037
01:18:08,203 --> 01:18:11,368
-Award him with two!
-Two? Okay put!

1038
01:18:18,837 --> 01:18:19,413
Chinamaya,

1039
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:24,685
teach them what you call Duryodhana,
Dushyasana, Karna and Shakuni together.

1040
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,482
Well, Bad quartet! Repeat it!

1041
01:18:28,783 --> 01:18:30,082
Yes. Ba...

1042
01:18:32,825 --> 01:18:35,186
Come on, say it! Bad quartet!

1043
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:37,092
Bada quarateet!

1044
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:42,239
-Badaa quaraateete!
-Oh my God! Oh my God!

1045
01:18:42,475 --> 01:18:45,191
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1046
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:46,231
-Shh!
-Shh!

1047
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:49,329
-It's wrong to split a word.
-Why is it wrong?

1048
01:18:49,548 --> 01:18:53,581
We must split and kill those
quartet like they pronounce.

1049
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:57,832
Oh my God! Oh my God!
[laughs]

1050
01:18:58,268 --> 01:19:02,479
My lord...
[groans]

1051
01:19:03,963 --> 01:19:07,440
Some human busted me.

1052
01:19:08,268 --> 01:19:09,990
He's young and tempered.

1053
01:19:11,024 --> 01:19:12,625
Human? A young man?

1054
01:19:13,366 --> 01:19:14,025
Strange! Strange!

1055
01:19:15,192 --> 01:19:16,307
-Hey Rambu
-Yes, my lord.

1056
01:19:16,564 --> 01:19:17,785
-Hey Jambu
-Yes, my lord.

1057
01:19:17,983 --> 01:19:21,100
I can't tolerate this any more.
Finish him with your magical powers.

1058
01:19:21,603 --> 01:19:23,259
-We'll knock him down and...
-And bring him to you.

1059
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,023
-bring his dead body, my lord.
-Go now.

1060
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:26,609
Wait!

1061
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:32,068
I feel like seeing the young warrior.
Bring him alive.

1062
01:19:32,577 --> 01:19:33,120
What do you say, Chinamaya?

1063
01:19:34,511 --> 01:19:34,978
Go!

1064
01:19:38,627 --> 01:19:40,950
[demonic spell]

1065
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:04,067
I'll spread from that side,
you spread from that side.

1066
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:06,409
[demonic spell]

1067
01:20:17,621 --> 01:20:18,745
What's this danger, Dharuka?

1068
01:20:21,246 --> 01:20:23,119
Forest fire!
It's coming fast towards us!

1069
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:30,367
Go back or seek refuge.

1070
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:35,536
Looks like it's illusion!

1071
01:20:50,348 --> 01:20:53,464
-What do we do now?
-This is a wind missile!

1072
01:20:58,978 --> 01:21:03,682
[groaning]

1073
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:09,950
[guffaws]

1074
01:21:16,232 --> 01:21:18,562
[guffaws]

1075
01:21:25,201 --> 01:21:27,366
Hail young hero! I appreciate you!

1076
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:32,169
Your courage has moved me.
You are very enchanting.

1077
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:35,996
Atlast you've gathered
courage and stood before me.

1078
01:21:36,528 --> 01:21:38,822
I'm also very happy. Come.

1079
01:21:39,202 --> 01:21:43,011
Hey boy! Your innocent face is
cooling my anger.

1080
01:21:43,317 --> 01:21:44,968
Your are a match to fight me.

1081
01:21:45,341 --> 01:21:47,952
Tell your name and seek refuge,
you'll become my associate.

1082
01:21:49,268 --> 01:21:51,667
Are you a warrior who
pleads on seeking refuge?

1083
01:21:52,262 --> 01:21:54,506
I'll make you seek refuge.
Watch out!

1084
01:21:56,838 --> 01:22:00,076
Aargh! You really hurt me!

1085
01:22:02,744 --> 01:22:06,131
But I don't feel like hitting back, boy!

1086
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:10,086
Tell that you are incapable.

1087
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:14,296
You can't just call me as a boy
and claim yourself to be an elder.

1088
01:22:14,585 --> 01:22:15,470
Show me your power.

1089
01:22:20,141 --> 01:22:24,902
I'm not getting enraged no matter how much
you provoke me. I feel pity about you boy.

1090
01:22:25,698 --> 01:22:30,381
O mother, ask your son to tell
his name and save his life.

1091
01:22:30,839 --> 01:22:34,451
-Son! Tell him your name.
-Impossible!

1092
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:36,246
Scared of enemy and tell my name? No way!

1093
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:37,517
Hey demon king!

1094
01:22:38,082 --> 01:22:40,467
Unable to win over me,
you've made this evil proposal.

1095
01:22:40,945 --> 01:22:42,813
You're cunning, coward,

1096
01:22:43,013 --> 01:22:45,123
-you don't have any pride.
-Hey! What's your arrogance?

1097
01:22:45,357 --> 01:22:48,834
You're going against me as if you're
here to test my power. Watch out!

1098
01:22:51,725 --> 01:22:53,138
[guffaws]

1099
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:59,099
-Oh! He made our leader lose his mace.
-Oh! Suprising!

1100
01:23:01,302 --> 01:23:07,308
[guffaws]

1101
01:23:35,723 --> 01:23:36,161
[bangs]

1102
01:23:52,852 --> 01:23:53,353
[bangs]

1103
01:24:07,701 --> 01:24:09,239
[bangs]

1104
01:24:23,145 --> 01:24:23,832
[bangs]

1105
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:39,934
[bangs]

1106
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:42,496
Aargh!

1107
01:25:10,076 --> 01:25:10,837
[thud]

1108
01:25:11,371 --> 01:25:17,157
Abhimanyu... Abhimanyu!
My son.

1109
01:25:17,228 --> 01:25:18,290
He's just unconscious, madam.

1110
01:25:18,575 --> 01:25:21,198
Ensure the demon not attacks
again before he regains conscious.

1111
01:25:26,336 --> 01:25:32,337
"I'm Lord Krishna's sister
who rules over heaven and hell"

1112
01:25:36,086 --> 01:25:42,081
"I'm Arjuna's wife who is the
mightiest warrior with magical arrows"

1113
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:48,060
"May this arrow kill the enemy"

1114
01:25:48,348 --> 01:25:52,817
and protect the heir of Pandavas

1115
01:25:54,784 --> 01:25:56,243
Forgive me mother, I seek your refuge.

1116
01:25:57,477 --> 01:25:58,776
It's an unwittingly committed mistake.

1117
01:25:59,402 --> 01:26:01,697
Please forgive me, mother.
It's an unwittingly committed mistake.

1118
01:26:02,038 --> 01:26:04,640
I'm Bhimasena's son, Ghatotkacha.

1119
01:26:04,961 --> 01:26:06,001
-Is it?
-Yes, mother.

1120
01:26:06,343 --> 01:26:08,582
It's an unwittingly committed mistake.
Please forgive me.

1121
01:26:11,326 --> 01:26:13,999
-Hey demon! Wherever you may be...
-Well...

1122
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,042
Victory be yours brother!

1123
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:18,102
I'm here under the
protection of mother.

1124
01:26:18,702 --> 01:26:21,454
Abhimanyu, he's your
elder brother Ghatotkacha.

1125
01:26:21,482 --> 01:26:22,427
-Huh?
-Yeah!

1126
01:26:22,804 --> 01:26:24,865
-Hi elder brother!
-Hi younger brother!

1127
01:26:28,362 --> 01:26:30,185
It is surprising!

1128
01:26:33,298 --> 01:26:35,155
I'm very elated, mother.
Extremely elated.

1129
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:37,594
You've made a rare visit
to us. Got you at last.

1130
01:26:37,768 --> 01:26:38,801
I'll not leave you.

1131
01:26:39,605 --> 01:26:42,948
Son, I told you not to wage
any war. What's this commotion?

1132
01:26:43,526 --> 01:26:45,540
Who are these humans?
Why are you arresting them?

1133
01:26:46,098 --> 01:26:47,932
Not arresting but hosting, mother.

1134
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,978
Do you know who she is?

1135
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:54,618
She's queen of uncle Arjuna!
Subhadra Devi!

1136
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:57,672
-Sister Hidambi.
-May God bless you, sister.

1137
01:26:57,873 --> 01:27:01,334
I'm seeing you for the
first time. Is he your son?

1138
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:02,686
Yes, mother.

1139
01:27:03,388 --> 01:27:04,920
God bless you, son.

1140
01:27:04,952 --> 01:27:05,642
God bless you.

1141
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:07,421
-Hey Rambu
-Yes, my lord.

1142
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:08,673
-Hey Jambu
-Yes, my lord.

1143
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:09,992
They are our friends!

1144
01:27:11,075 --> 01:27:12,436
frendz.

1145
01:27:13,099 --> 01:27:14,032
Bow to them!

1146
01:27:17,655 --> 01:27:18,448
Frendz.

1147
01:27:19,999 --> 01:27:23,503
-Madam Subhadra, I'll take leave now.
-See you.

1148
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:25,642
-Hey Rambu
-Yes, my lord.

1149
01:27:25,734 --> 01:27:26,916
-Hey Jambu
-Yes, my lord.

1150
01:27:26,962 --> 01:27:28,409
Our friends must be
given a grand reception.

1151
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:31,373
Arrange songs, dance and music!

1152
01:27:32,009 --> 01:27:32,768
Come... come.

1153
01:27:33,651 --> 01:27:34,121
Mother...

1154
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:36,790
Brother...

1155
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:41,247
Elders... Elders!

1156
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:45,410
Why should we these
elders with us for the wedding?

1157
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:49,300
Drona, Ashwathama and
Kripacharya are not even our relatives.

1158
01:27:49,642 --> 01:27:51,342
I struck off their names
at the begininng itself, brother.

1159
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:54,945
Bheeshma and Vidhura are our grandfathers
amd we belong to their lineage.

1160
01:27:55,316 --> 01:27:57,709
Lord Krishna will definitely
ask why they haven't come.

1161
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:00,174
What will be your reply, uncle?

1162
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,773
What should we answer?
They are still on Pandavas side.

1163
01:28:03,877 --> 01:28:08,064
Hence, let's them that old men
are paralyzed or can't move.

1164
01:28:08,275 --> 01:28:10,669
Well said, Karna.
I struck off the oldies too.

1165
01:28:12,382 --> 01:28:16,441
By striking off all the names and if it is
just four of us who attends the wedding,

1166
01:28:16,698 --> 01:28:18,233
How could it be any glory?

1167
01:28:19,051 --> 01:28:23,819
Not just four of us, Duryodhana. All
your brothers would attend the marriage

1168
01:28:24,076 --> 01:28:27,274
All the hundred brothers are
enough, it will be very grand,

1169
01:28:27,524 --> 01:28:29,212
and we would can keep our word too.

1170
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,860
Well said Uncle!
Then, what is our immediate duty?

1171
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:33,016
Travel preparations.

1172
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:35,505
Hail lord!

1173
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:40,239
The grandfather must come
immediately to Lakshmana's room.

1174
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:43,996
Uncle, go immediately.
He may've created a new problem.

1175
01:28:45,011 --> 01:28:48,036
No need, he himself is here.
Come son.

1176
01:28:52,695 --> 01:28:53,686
Character of youth!

1177
01:28:54,867 --> 01:28:58,535
You'll have a feeling of
socializing as your wedding is fixed.

1178
01:28:58,615 --> 01:29:00,793
Yes grandpa, I don't have any stage fear.

1179
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:02,882
I'm came here because
I can speak in public.

1180
01:29:03,136 --> 01:29:04,241
I don't want to get married.

1181
01:29:04,442 --> 01:29:05,748
-What?
-Yes, father.

1182
01:29:06,078 --> 01:29:09,081
It's not bravery
without seeing the bride.

1183
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:12,425
I was expecting this, Duryodhana.

1184
01:29:12,677 --> 01:29:16,201
Our boy forgot about this
respecting our decision.

1185
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:17,857
Yes, now I remembered it.

1186
01:29:18,176 --> 01:29:22,759
Yes, grandson.
Princes like you must go and see any girl,

1187
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:26,471
if you find them beautiful,
you should even fight Gods and win them.

1188
01:29:26,505 --> 01:29:26,987
Indeed.

1189
01:29:27,319 --> 01:29:30,107
Abhimanyu may hesitate but you wouldn't.

1190
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:32,925
Let's go to Dwaraka immediately,

1191
01:29:33,026 --> 01:29:34,219
Upon reaching the bride's house,

1192
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,648
I'll call the bride and you can meet her.

1193
01:29:37,758 --> 01:29:39,096
I'm sure you will like her.

1194
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:42,062
Even if I don't like,
I must meet the bride before our wedding.

1195
01:29:42,228 --> 01:29:43,031
That's my vow!

1196
01:29:43,996 --> 01:29:47,685
-Alright, grandson. Get ready to travel.
-I'm always ready to travel.

1197
01:29:51,289 --> 01:29:54,961
[applaud]

1198
01:29:57,061 --> 01:29:57,814
-Son
-Mother

1199
01:29:58,171 --> 01:29:59,312
What's this senseless dancing?

1200
01:29:59,413 --> 01:30:01,476
Arrange a play that preaches moral.

1201
01:30:01,585 --> 01:30:02,361
I'll appreciate you.

1202
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:05,816
You heard my mother's order,
right Chinamaya?

1203
01:30:06,344 --> 01:30:08,691
Yes. We have the story
of Mohini- Bhasmasura,

1204
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:14,042
which preaches the moral about consquences
of granting boon to evil persons.

1205
01:30:15,655 --> 01:30:16,913
I'll arrange it. See and enjoy.

Sasi...

1210
01:35:40,957 --> 01:35:43,220
It's me! Open the door.

1211
01:35:44,537 --> 01:35:46,147
They came to get you dressed as a bride,

1212
01:35:46,566 --> 01:35:48,238
Why did you send them
out and closed the door?

1213
01:35:48,821 --> 01:35:49,529
Why don't you talk to me?

1214
01:35:50,518 --> 01:35:51,088
Open the door.

1215
01:35:51,956 --> 01:35:54,769
How many times do I've to tell you?
I don't like this marriage.

1216
01:35:58,018 --> 01:36:00,522
Sasi, there is nothing to do
with your consent or mine.

1217
01:36:00,849 --> 01:36:02,520
Don't think your protests
will cancel this marriage.

1218
01:36:02,893 --> 01:36:03,898
The groom's family is coming.

1219
01:36:04,392 --> 01:36:06,583
Your objections will not
be accepted. Be careful.

1220
01:36:07,028 --> 01:36:08,345
Get through it happily.

1221
01:36:09,627 --> 01:36:10,853
Happily?

1222
01:36:11,213 --> 01:36:14,346
You dashed my hopes, broke my heart,

1223
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:18,072
and spoilt my mind.
Infact I don't want to live at all.

1224
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:20,355
What are you saying, Sasi?

1225
01:36:20,969 --> 01:36:21,536
What happened, sister?

1226
01:36:21,697 --> 01:36:24,655
What could it be? Your ideas which you've
pitched into her mind since childhood,

1227
01:36:24,689 --> 01:36:25,699
are taking toll on me now.

1228
01:36:26,175 --> 01:36:28,281
Don't get angry, sister-in-law.
She is just a little girl.

1229
01:36:28,661 --> 01:36:32,181
Give her little time to calm down.

1230
01:36:32,513 --> 01:36:36,242
You will see her excited and
enthusiastic by tomorrow.

1231
01:36:36,251 --> 01:36:39,113
Whatever, Krishna. I'm always optimistic
because you solve all the things.

1232
01:36:39,863 --> 01:36:43,296
It's your responsibility to conduct
this marriage without any hitch.

1233
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:52,886

What?

1268
01:40:31,347 --> 01:40:33,023
He gave his word to get
Sasi married to Abhimanyu,

1269
01:40:33,296 --> 01:40:36,912
And he's he shamlessly breaking it to
get her married to Duryodhana's son?

1270
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:40,209
How could Balarama being
your own brother insult you?

1271
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:43,916
What can we do now, sister?
We lost all our wealth, right?

1272
01:40:44,485 --> 01:40:46,721
You just lost wealth not courage.
How can he even think like that?

1273
01:40:47,602 --> 01:40:50,360
How can the wealth worshippers
see courage, sister?

1274
01:40:51,075 --> 01:40:55,920
He even insulted by saying 'The Pandavas
are nothing compared to Kauravas'

1275
01:40:56,013 --> 01:40:57,315
Hey Rambu.
Hey Jambu.

1276
01:40:57,597 --> 01:40:58,620
Blow the war bugle!

1279
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:09,342
My dear associates,
get ready with your armies and weapons.

1280
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:10,889
We are going to war now.

1281
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:15,263
Hail leader!

1282
01:41:15,856 --> 01:41:18,379
Whom are you waging a war against,
brother? I'll also join you.

1283
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:21,108
Why do you toil when I'm there, brother?
My dear associates...

1284
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:23,738
Son... Son!

1285
01:41:24,586 --> 01:41:28,093
I heard you, mother.
Not only did he break the promise,

1286
01:41:28,186 --> 01:41:33,318
but joined hands with those evil Kauravas
and belittled my world famous father.

1287
01:41:33,543 --> 01:41:36,983
These Yadavas are very proud and arrogant!

1288
01:41:37,184 --> 01:41:39,048
I'll avenge them by

1289
01:41:39,257 --> 01:41:43,693
wiping off both the Yadavas and
the Kauravas together in one go.

Hail leader!

1297
01:42:14,701 --> 01:42:18,772
Son, it is the same if either of you
wages the war against my brother.

1298
01:42:18,858 --> 01:42:20,055
Won't it bring a bad name to me?

1299
01:42:20,749 --> 01:42:25,202
Then, I'll go to Hastinapuram
and finish at least Kauravas.

1300
01:42:25,283 --> 01:42:28,538
You can't kill them, son.
Your father has made vows.

1301
01:42:28,748 --> 01:42:30,622
The Kauravas must live to die
in the hands of the Pandavas.

1302
01:42:30,938 --> 01:42:32,609
Did you see, brother?

1303
01:42:32,803 --> 01:42:35,856
Our mothers' words have
made our strengths useless.

1304
01:42:37,064 --> 01:42:39,635
Follow my orders, son.
I'll appreciate you.

1305
01:42:40,273 --> 01:42:41,209
Go to Dwaraka,

1306
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:43,624
use your magical powers
and bring Sasirekha here.

1307
01:42:43,918 --> 01:42:45,343
I'll get her married to him.

1308
01:42:45,857 --> 01:42:48,427
Good, your order will be
implemented, mother.

1309
01:42:48,471 --> 01:42:49,307
I'll go immediately.

1310
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:52,963
-My dear associates!
-Hail leader!

1311
01:42:53,663 --> 01:42:54,883
-Son!
-Mother!

1312
01:42:55,226 --> 01:42:59,661
I'll let you go only if you promise,
not to hurt or harm anyone there.

1313
01:43:00,535 --> 01:43:02,793
-My brother, Sri Krishna...
-Is he a friend?

1314
01:43:02,824 --> 01:43:04,193
My respects to him.

1315
01:43:04,401 --> 01:43:09,317
-Upon reaching there, meet him...
-Not just meeting, worship him.

1316
01:43:09,458 --> 01:43:10,587
He'll be pleased.

1317
01:43:10,897 --> 01:43:14,047
-He will tell you the plan.
-So be it.

1318
01:43:14,263 --> 01:43:16,047
Hail mother!

1319
01:43:18,888 --> 01:43:22,425
Hey Brother! You shall protect
them till I come back return.

1320
01:43:22,921 --> 01:43:24,165
As you say, brother.

How am I to find Sasirekha among
them? How can I identify her?

1328
01:45:31,932 --> 01:45:33,282
I came without knowing any details.

1329
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:39,599

Your enlightment is good, but
tell me who you really are?

-Yes.

Don't you know who I am?

That's why I'm asking, right?

1355
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:09,828
An ignorant person will
not learn even if taught.

1356

Hey grandpa! Stop your argument.

1357
01:47:12,129 --> 01:47:13,382
I don't care who you may be,

1358
01:47:14,603 --> 01:47:18,259
Just tell me,
where can I find Sasirekha?

1359
01:47:19,719 --> 01:47:21,812
What! Asking my help and shouting at me.

1360
01:47:22,142 --> 01:47:25,461
Tell me your name and seek
refuge humbly. I'll show you.

Hey grandpa! Who do you think I'm?
Be careful.

I can't hold my anger long,

1363
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:31,563
I'll drown you and your
Dwaraka in the ocean.

1364

Wow! Are you very powerful?

1365
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:35,751
Why don't you tell me that?

1366
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:39,132
You needn't do such great things,

1367
01:47:39,188 --> 01:47:44,806
I'm old and can't walk.
Carry me, I'll show you Sasirekha.

01:47:44,941 --> 01:47:48,155
That's better. Get up!

1369
01:47:48,432 --> 01:47:53,144
"May God bless you!"

1370
01:47:53,886 --> 01:47:58,825
"May God bless you!"

1371
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:04,751
You're so heavy!

1372
01:48:05,464 --> 01:48:08,679
You threatened to drown Dwaraka.
Can't you carry me?

1373
01:48:15,946 --> 01:48:18,421
[chuckles]

1374
01:48:18,756 --> 01:48:20,221
Carry me son... carry me.

1375
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:29,351
Did you eat elephants for dinner?
What's the magic?

1376
01:48:29,452 --> 01:48:31,368
"Big illusion will envelop smaller one"

1377
01:48:31,609 --> 01:48:33,747
"That'll vanish.
This will vanish."

1378
01:48:34,156 --> 01:48:36,067
"I'm there on the other side.
It's me even in here"

1379
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:37,922
"I'm everything"

1380
01:48:38,224 --> 01:48:43,028
Oh! I got it! I bow before you!

1381
01:48:46,557 --> 01:48:49,867
I bow before you, Lord Krishna!

1382
01:48:50,027 --> 01:48:53,627
Bless you!

1383
01:48:54,202 --> 01:48:56,616
I'm blessed, waiting for your order.

1384
01:48:58,988 --> 01:49:01,123
Your next duty is...

1385
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:05,510
Tranfigure yourself as Sasirekha
and get married to Lakshmana Kumara.

1386
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:07,542
Teach the Kauravas a lesson.

1387
01:49:09,091 --> 01:49:10,791
Divine instruction!

1388
01:49:11,141 --> 01:49:11,627
Myna,

1389
01:49:14,050 --> 01:49:16,532
From now, you're his favourite maid.

1390
01:49:17,488 --> 01:49:18,155
No problem.

1391
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,952
-Can I take leave now?
-Be careful, nephew.

1392
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:26,214
Myna, show me the way to my harem.

1393
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:04,780
Madam Sairekha...
Madam Sasirekha...

1394
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:24,788
Hail Lord Krishna!
Hail Lord Krishna!

1395
01:50:27,145 --> 01:50:29,227
Hail mother!

1396
01:50:29,308 --> 01:50:31,779
Wow! What a beauty!

1397
01:50:31,787 --> 01:50:33,061
Your daughter-in-law is very beautiful.

1398
01:50:34,136 --> 01:50:37,446
-You didn't make a mess there, right son?
-No mother... not at all.

1399
01:50:37,605 --> 01:50:39,328
Everything went off peacefully.

1400
01:50:40,797 --> 01:50:43,050
Lord Krishna's blessings, mother.

1401
01:50:43,866 --> 01:50:47,048
I've to go back,
host the Kauravas,

1402
01:50:47,073 --> 01:50:50,519
And marry Lakshmana Kumara.

1403
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:52,491
-You?
-Yes mother, I have to.

1404
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:56,992
Sister-in-law is waking up.
I'll take leave.

1405
01:51:01,408 --> 01:51:05,386
Dashed my hopes and spoilt my mind.

1406
01:51:07,097 --> 01:51:09,012
I don't want to live.

1407
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:14,479
-Sasi... Sasi...
-Poor girl is still lamenting.

1408
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:19,489
Sasi, look! It's me!

1409
01:51:20,931 --> 01:51:24,240
Aunt! How did you come here?

1410
01:51:24,684 --> 01:51:26,966
I didn't come.
It's who came to our place.

1411
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,268
Me?

1412
01:51:32,408 --> 01:51:33,139
Where are we?

1413
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:36,694
Don't get scared, I'll tell you.
Get up dear.

1414
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:42,261
Did you hear me?
Ruin the wedding.

1415
01:51:43,107 --> 01:51:44,368
-Chinamaya
-My leader!

1416
01:51:44,592 --> 01:51:46,380
Use your magical powers and illusion

1417
01:51:46,694 --> 01:51:49,132
And build a guest city
for Kauravas in Dwaraka.

1418
01:51:49,232 --> 01:51:49,994
Yes

1419
01:51:50,236 --> 01:51:52,607
Spellbound them with your magic.

1420
01:51:52,712 --> 01:51:53,426
Hail leader!

1421
01:51:54,495 --> 01:51:55,580
-Hey Rambu
-My lord

1422
01:51:55,604 --> 01:51:56,541
-Hey Rambu
-My lord

1423
01:51:56,679 --> 01:51:59,420
Use your intelligence and
teach Kauravas a fitting lesson.

1424
01:52:00,438 --> 01:52:02,875
-Hosting a wedding is a tough task.
-But ruining it is a piece of cake.

1425
01:52:02,951 --> 01:52:08,792
[cheering]
Stop!

1426
01:52:09,787 --> 01:52:10,193
Get going!

1427
01:52:18,207 --> 01:52:19,131
Where's my brother?

1428
01:52:21,145 --> 01:52:21,567
Brother!

1429
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:53,066
Beau got beaten up!

1430
01:52:53,267 --> 01:52:53,843
Who is it?

1431
01:52:55,414 --> 01:52:59,166
Sasi, how did you come here?
-Stay away.

1432
01:52:59,401 --> 01:53:01,864
Calling me now by leaving me in solitude.

1433
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,583
-What is this, Sasi?
-Stay away.

1434
01:53:04,408 --> 01:53:05,147
Why are you so angry?

1435
01:53:05,763 --> 01:53:09,258
Don't you know I didn't take
chances respecting elders' words.

1436
01:53:09,477 --> 01:53:12,029
Fair enough! You must get a
good name for respecting elders,

1437
01:53:12,556 --> 01:53:14,502
and I must get bad name
for going against elders.

1438
01:53:14,711 --> 01:53:17,527
Enough, good bye to you and your love.

1439
01:53:17,677 --> 01:53:18,720
Now, it's brotherly love between us.

1440
01:53:18,993 --> 01:53:20,686
Sasi! What are you saying?

1441
01:53:21,001 --> 01:53:22,464
That's it.

1442
01:53:23,568 --> 01:53:25,633
I can't bear your sorrows or
pangs of separation any more.

1443
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:28,988
I promised to marry Lakshmana
Kumara. And I'll stick to my word.

1444
01:53:30,049 --> 01:53:31,292
Is it my Sasi who is saying this?

1445
01:53:31,783 --> 01:53:35,100
No, I'm a brand new Sasi.
Totally changed.

1446
01:53:35,548 --> 01:53:38,188
I'll marry Lakshmana Kumara,
ride on elephant,

1447
01:53:38,266 --> 01:53:41,113
-and go to palace in a procession.
-Sasi, what's this nasty?

1448
01:53:41,419 --> 01:53:44,440
-Are you possessed by ghost?
-Not ghost but demon.

1449
01:53:45,041 --> 01:53:49,400
But now, it's brotherly love between us.
Come brother. Come.

1450
01:53:52,255 --> 01:53:53,850
I'm really very lucky, dear.

1451
01:53:53,949 --> 01:53:57,166
Krishna, Rukmini,
Balarama, Revathi,

1452
01:53:57,227 --> 01:53:58,201
everyone will come to my home for you.

1453
01:53:58,937 --> 01:54:01,404
Aunt... where is my brother-in-law?

1454
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:04,282
I'm coming, sister-in-law.
Come, brother.

1455
01:54:09,881 --> 01:54:10,817
Did you see, brother?

1456
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,313
Leave me to Lakshmana Kumara,

1457
01:54:13,506 --> 01:54:14,438
and you take your Sasi.

1458
01:54:15,242 --> 01:54:17,055
[chuckles]

1459
01:54:17,138 --> 01:54:19,617
Is this Lord Krishna's
instruction too, son?

1460
01:54:20,154 --> 01:54:21,150
Yes, mother.

1461
01:54:21,525 --> 01:54:26,420
Only God knows how that groom
is going to bear me as a bride.

1462
01:54:28,782 --> 01:54:30,917
How about brother-in-law's voice, aunt?

1463
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:36,881
Don't worry about me, sister-in-law,
take good care of him.

1464
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:41,227
Auspicious time is nearing,
I'm leaving now.

1465
01:54:41,793 --> 01:54:42,891
Hail mother!

1466
01:54:46,870 --> 01:54:48,803
Hail Lord Krishna!

1467
01:55:12,202 --> 01:55:13,631
Place it here. Quick.

1468
01:55:19,638 --> 01:55:20,796
What's this, master?

1469
01:55:21,437 --> 01:55:22,788
This is the plan of the Guest city.

1470
01:55:23,077 --> 01:55:26,529
Look...
These are harems.

1471
01:55:28,947 --> 01:55:30,959
These are the magical houses.

1472
01:55:31,709 --> 01:55:33,498
What are these lines, master?

1473
01:55:33,685 --> 01:55:34,427
Build them.

1474
01:55:34,651 --> 01:55:38,745
We shall check the errors in
the plan and then execute it.

1475
01:55:38,834 --> 01:55:40,285
Alright. Be on it.

1476
01:55:40,423 --> 01:55:43,123
But, where is the door to enter inside?

1477
01:55:44,332 --> 01:55:46,406
Here, this is the main entrance.

1478
01:55:46,833 --> 01:55:48,482
-Main entrance.
-Yes.

1479
01:55:49,636 --> 01:55:50,502
It shouldn't be in that
direction. Place it there.

1480
01:55:50,594 --> 01:55:53,771
No, that's north. It doesn't come
under the construction standards.

1481
01:55:53,848 --> 01:55:56,121
Your construction standards is for
those who can't think on their own.

1482
01:55:56,314 --> 01:55:56,980
But not for us.

1483
01:55:57,205 --> 01:56:00,211
Anti friends enter from that direction,
so the entrance should be placed there.

1484
01:56:00,471 --> 01:56:01,787
Alright. As you say.

1485
01:56:01,864 --> 01:56:02,369
Get up.

1486
01:56:04,121 --> 01:56:04,726
Close your eyes.

[cheering]

1491
01:56:42,861 --> 01:56:44,758
Astonishing!

1492
01:56:44,914 --> 01:56:46,297
Don't praise.

1493
01:56:46,679 --> 01:56:49,736
Well master, it's all empty.

1494
01:56:49,933 --> 01:56:53,743
Where are the things to
take task our anti friends?

1495
01:56:54,048 --> 01:56:56,075
Things? Look yonder!

1497
01:57:05,691 --> 01:57:07,427
They are serpent jewels.

-These are...
-Am... Aha....

1499
01:57:11,481 --> 01:57:12,321
Shh!

Madam Sasirekha!

Madam bride!

1511
01:59:21,284 --> 01:59:23,883
It's morning, please wake up.

1512
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:25,923
Madam bride.

1513
01:59:26,357 --> 01:59:32,284
[groaning]

1514
01:59:41,509 --> 01:59:45,374
Madam... Sasirekha...
why are you staring at me?

1515
01:59:45,856 --> 01:59:47,355
I'm your favourite maid.

1516
01:59:48,026 --> 01:59:51,534
Yes... you're my favourite maid.
What happened?

1517
01:59:51,700 --> 01:59:55,011
Did you have any bad dream?
You gave a loud cry!

1518
01:59:55,508 --> 01:59:58,806
Yes, a bad dream,
dreamt of becoming a devil.

1519
01:59:59,056 --> 02:00:00,563
It seems my voice too had changed.

1520
02:00:00,703 --> 02:00:02,872
-Have I got back my original voice?
-Yes, madam.

1521
02:00:03,195 --> 02:00:06,509
Please be gentle, other maids are scared.

1522
02:00:06,968 --> 02:00:08,661
Oh maids!

1523
02:00:11,172 --> 02:00:12,165
Why are you afraid of me?

1524
02:00:14,109 --> 02:00:14,924
Oh!

1525
02:00:16,690 --> 02:00:18,314
What's this?
Who put a broken pedestal here?

1526
02:00:18,416 --> 02:00:20,128
Poor girls! Don't shout at them.

1527
02:00:20,421 --> 02:00:24,210
I could've been little
subtle. Maids, come.

1528
02:00:25,624 --> 02:00:29,489
Madam, you appear very strange today.

1529
02:00:30,691 --> 02:00:34,621
Do you think I'm still that old Sasirekha?

1530
02:00:34,962 --> 02:00:39,201
No. I'm the fiance of Lakshmana Kumara.

1531
02:00:39,409 --> 02:00:43,926
It means my husband is the
future king and I'm the future queen.

1532
02:00:44,084 --> 02:00:47,801
Shh! You shouldn't say like that madam.
Look, your mother Revathi is coming.

1533
02:00:48,242 --> 02:00:51,396
Mother? Oh God! Mother!

1534
02:00:54,204 --> 02:00:56,632
Hail mother, I bow to you.

1535
02:00:56,978 --> 02:01:00,770
Is this true?
Did you see her Rukmini?

1536
02:01:01,178 --> 02:01:04,107
Mother Rukmini! I bow to you.

1537
02:01:05,105 --> 02:01:10,813
-Hail Krishna!
-Bless you!

1538
02:01:11,943 --> 02:01:13,987
Have we become strangers already, Sasi?

1539
02:01:14,252 --> 02:01:15,667
You're showing so much respect.

1540
02:01:16,139 --> 02:01:17,907
I'm just following your advice.

1541
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:21,426
Let it be anyone's advice dear,
you've become obedient.

1542
02:01:21,768 --> 02:01:22,733
That's enough for me.

1543
02:01:23,124 --> 02:01:25,898
Krishna, I'm really very happy.

1544
02:01:26,513 --> 02:01:29,133
If you conduct this
marriage with a great fanfare...

1545
02:01:29,326 --> 02:01:31,621
As you say sister-in-law.
You will see it.

Did you see the lavishness
of the Yadavas, uncle?

02:06:07,375 --> 02:06:09,224
This fortune, these riches,

1597
02:06:09,497 --> 02:06:10,253
this exhibition,

1598
02:06:10,799 --> 02:06:13,291
I think they did this to upstage us.

1599
02:06:14,057 --> 02:06:15,782
Any doubt in it, Duryodhana?

1600
02:06:16,247 --> 02:06:19,785
When Krishna promised
to conduct the marriage,

1601
02:06:20,058 --> 02:06:21,810
I expected this grand affair.

1602
02:06:22,267 --> 02:06:24,998
Whatever they may do,
it's nothing compared to your riches.

1603
02:06:25,095 --> 02:06:26,318
Well said, uncle.

1604
02:06:28,015 --> 02:06:29,499
We are blessed along with you, Lords.

1605
02:06:29,626 --> 02:06:33,246
We're received the same grand
reception and hospitality as that of you!

grandeur have wasted their lives."

"This is what you call prosperity."

02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:51,249
"Your kinsman's riches,
run out of words to praise it!"

1611
02:06:51,411 --> 02:06:51,974
Shh!

1612
02:06:52,634 --> 02:06:54,245
What's this nuisance, uncle?

1613
02:07:00,939 --> 02:07:04,613
You both are scholars but
have no common sense.

1614
02:07:04,686 --> 02:07:05,716
-As you say.

1615
02:07:05,886 --> 02:07:09,396
How dare you praise
others before your lord?

1616
02:07:09,972 --> 02:07:12,354
Our mistake.
Please forgive us, lord.

1617
02:07:12,546 --> 02:07:14,217
We got emotional and blurted out truth...

1618
02:07:14,576 --> 02:07:18,010
Though it's true, never praise others.

1619
02:07:18,178 --> 02:07:20,342
We are grooms' side.
Behave highhandedly!

1620
02:07:20,569 --> 02:07:23,509
Finding faults in everything,
irritate them.

1621
02:07:24,234 --> 02:07:26,196
-Got you lord.
-What did you get?

1622
02:07:26,225 --> 02:07:29,721
Watch out now!
We'll torture your kinsmen.

What if she feels shy to meet him?

She can't be a brave
wife if she feels shy,

I want to talk to her.

in our reception, guests?

02:11:29,539 --> 02:11:31,655
Shortcoming at peaks!
Come with us, we'll show you.

1685

Such a cheap blankets for us?
-What?

1686
02:11:39,496 --> 02:11:42,695
When we gave this to maid servants
of our village, they've discarded them.

1687
02:11:43,096 --> 02:11:45,655
Respected guests,
we're aren't aware of your status.

1688
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:47,759
Just order us what you
want, we'll arrange it.

1689
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:50,566
-I want silk blanket.
-Okay.

1690
02:11:50,839 --> 02:11:54,125
-I want silk carpet.
-Oh! Okay.

1691
02:11:54,321 --> 02:11:56,201
Just don't say okay.

1692
02:11:56,491 --> 02:12:00,073
-Silk carpet... got it?
-Okay.

1693
02:12:03,763 --> 02:12:06,121
Hello wedding hosts,
what are you doing here?

1694
02:12:06,314 --> 02:12:09,903
We want fans there and
young maidens to blow it.

1695
02:12:10,102 --> 02:12:12,811
-What a wish!
-What a nasty wish!

1696
02:12:12,935 --> 02:12:15,227
-What nonsense?
-Get out!

1697
02:12:15,247 --> 02:12:17,891
-Do you know who I am?
-Do you know who we are?

1698
02:12:17,982 --> 02:12:18,472
Shh!

1699
02:12:19,095 --> 02:12:21,120
You're getting angry unable
to understand the language.

1700
02:12:21,383 --> 02:12:24,005
What he said means great!

1701
02:12:24,293 --> 02:12:25,826
You're scholars,
don't you know it?

1702
02:12:26,035 --> 02:12:29,436
We were just getting it,
you said it.

1703
02:12:30,327 --> 02:12:32,187
I'll tell the meaning of other word.

1704
02:12:32,322 --> 02:12:34,625
The other word means respect.
Am I right?

1705
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:36,852
Yes...
[chuckles]

1706
02:12:37,301 --> 02:12:39,503
Is it that?
-Yes, it is that.

1707
02:12:39,762 --> 02:12:40,681
Then come here.

1708
02:12:48,901 --> 02:12:51,762
Such a cheap cot for a
respected man like me?

1709
02:12:52,724 --> 02:12:53,705
Foam bed.. Foam bed.

1710
02:12:55,736 --> 02:12:59,496
-I want foam bed.
-Foam bed? We'll get it.

I bow to you Shakuni grandpa.

1725
02:13:47,321 --> 02:13:51,429
Oh! Why have you displayed the
things that are eye-catching?

1726
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:53,788
-They're for you, take a look.
-Really?

1727
02:13:58,628 --> 02:14:01,650
Oh my goodness!
They are more delicate than me.

1728
02:14:01,967 --> 02:14:06,222
A touch broke the jewel,
I've lots of much stronger jewels.

1729
02:14:06,689 --> 02:14:10,679
Yes, dear.
You're jovial without being ashamed.

1730
02:14:11,352 --> 02:14:12,416
I'm happy.

1731
02:14:13,174 --> 02:14:16,774
Your groom wants to meet you.
Let's meet him, come.

1732
02:14:17,305 --> 02:14:19,491
Then I too have a condition.

1733
02:14:19,815 --> 02:14:22,984
If you want me to meet groom,
you must show your skill.

1734
02:14:23,247 --> 02:14:29,066
Good granddaughter,
but I've many skills.

1735
02:14:29,291 --> 02:14:32,278
-Which one shall I show you?
-Why anything else?

1736
02:14:32,609 --> 02:14:36,304
I want to see you play dice.

1737
02:14:36,413 --> 02:14:38,651
Play, else I'll not meet the groom.

1738
02:14:39,554 --> 02:14:43,307
Grand daughters are like this,
playing fun with grandpas.

1739
02:14:43,784 --> 02:14:47,613
Okay, I'll play only once.
Tell me your number.

1740
02:14:49,463 --> 02:14:49,976
Two!

1741
02:14:52,737 --> 02:14:53,977
If I lose I'll not meet the groom.

1742
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:57,784
-You've started again, then I'll not...

1745
02:15:03,503 --> 02:15:04,700
Ah! Two!

Two... Yes, it's two.

1747
02:15:07,297 --> 02:15:09,547
If one becomes two,
then six will become three.

1748
02:15:09,656 --> 02:15:11,397
We both have won.

1749
02:15:11,945 --> 02:15:14,179
Grandpa, you play dice very well.

1750
02:15:15,199 --> 02:15:19,829
Isn't that groom near the lake?
I'll meet him. Come Myna.

1751
02:15:28,393 --> 02:15:29,364
Why is she behaving like this?

1752
02:15:29,797 --> 02:15:35,392
Is Sasirekha an illusionist or
was it a flash that blinded my eye?

1753
02:15:35,625 --> 02:15:39,680
Looking at her behaviour and
attitude, my son may...

1754
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:43,537
No need to fear.
Our Lakshmana is her perfect match.

02:27:07,709 --> 02:27:09,650
I fell in love with her, desired her,

1876
02:27:10,205 --> 02:27:10,977
and sang a song too.

1877
02:27:12,658 --> 02:27:15,748
-What about the bride?
-Bride? Silly bride!

1878
02:27:15,989 --> 02:27:17,916
She asked me stay away
saying elders are there.

1879
02:27:18,095 --> 02:27:19,123
Told me to wait till tomorrow.

1880
02:27:19,384 --> 02:27:21,909
How can I wait till tomorrow, Sarathy?

1881
02:27:22,167 --> 02:27:25,638
You're strong and great,
Abhimanyu would be dead by now.

1882
02:27:25,713 --> 02:27:27,697
-Well said, Sarathy!
-Why Lord?

1883
02:27:27,891 --> 02:27:30,847
Nothing.
They get stuck on joining.

1884
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:36,963
They ate the feast themselves
and kept empty vessels for us.

1885
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:37,618
Did you see?

1886
02:27:41,503 --> 02:27:46,494
-Sharma
-Shastri

1887
02:27:46,552 --> 02:27:48,780
-Oh! Hard vadas!
-Hard vadas!

1888
02:27:48,856 --> 02:27:50,018
-Stuffed sweets.
-Stuffed sweets.

1889
02:27:51,777 --> 02:27:52,779
Come here.

1890
02:27:57,378 --> 02:28:01,227
I told you to play with kinsmen,
are you playing with me?

1891
02:28:01,237 --> 02:28:03,409
-Are you possessed by ghost?
-No...

1892
02:28:03,728 --> 02:28:06,932
What's that? I've been watching
you since coming here,

1893
02:28:07,071 --> 02:28:09,149
you seem to losing your senses,

1894
02:28:09,350 --> 02:28:13,346
if you don't start behaving sensibly,
I'll get you a good head massage.

1895
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:14,646
Be careful!

1896
02:28:14,962 --> 02:28:16,173
Okay okay!

1897
02:28:19,105 --> 02:28:20,008
-Sarma.
-Yeah

1898
02:28:20,457 --> 02:28:22,137
-What is this?
-Hand.

1899
02:28:22,582 --> 02:28:23,833
-How many are these?
-Three!

1900
02:28:24,122 --> 02:28:24,964
Pinch me.

1901
02:28:27,152 --> 02:28:28,168
Then...

1902
02:28:31,784 --> 02:28:33,558
-Want carpet.
-Shh!

1903
02:28:34,525 --> 02:28:35,587
Abracadabra!

1904
02:28:35,955 --> 02:28:37,257
[laughing]
-Shh!

1905
02:28:37,970 --> 02:28:40,113
Abracadabra!
[laughing]

1906
02:28:42,324 --> 02:28:43,428
Abracadabra!

1907
02:28:43,629 --> 02:28:45,662
[laughing]
-Shh!

1908
02:28:46,406 --> 02:28:47,495
Foam bed!

1909
02:28:55,318 --> 02:28:57,277
We want foam bed.

1910
02:28:57,782 --> 02:28:58,586
Shh!

1911
02:28:58,959 --> 02:29:02,322
Abracadabra!
[laughing]

1912
02:29:02,523 --> 02:29:04,153
Shh!
[door opened]

1913
02:29:04,809 --> 02:29:06,709
Enemies are coming.

1914
02:29:11,201 --> 02:29:12,925
-Oh god!
-Aah!

1915
02:29:13,765 --> 02:29:19,751
Was the feast thing a magic
or an illusion or a spell?

1916
02:29:20,411 --> 02:29:23,488
-What do you say?
-Nothing, pure hallucination.

1917
02:29:24,206 --> 02:29:25,786
-You think like that?
-Yes.

1918
02:29:31,709 --> 02:29:32,790
Is it carpet?

1919
02:29:33,583 --> 02:29:34,945
They removed smaller one
and laid a bigger one.

1920
02:29:35,522 --> 02:29:38,740
They thought it's a bigger carpet.

1921
02:29:39,221 --> 02:29:42,423
Their ancestors must come down for it.
[laughing]

1922
02:29:43,282 --> 02:29:44,548
-Betel leaves!
-Let's have them!

1923
02:29:49,868 --> 02:29:51,425

1924
02:29:59,593 --> 02:30:01,793
[chuckling]

1925
02:30:04,445 --> 02:30:05,550
Sarma...

1926
02:30:06,684 --> 02:30:07,891
What we saw, vanished away.

1927
02:30:08,249 --> 02:30:09,593
What vanished, appeared again.

1928
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:18,402
-Do you think this is also hallucination?
-Yes, hallucination only.

1929
02:30:19,195 --> 02:30:20,283
-Whoa?
-Oh!

1930
02:30:21,083 --> 02:30:23,023
-Yeah [chuckles]
-Eh?

1931
02:30:26,171 --> 02:30:26,903
Nah!

1932
02:30:29,410 --> 02:30:34,427
-Reason for this hallucinations?
-Nothing much, a form of madness.

1933
02:30:36,426 --> 02:30:37,901
What's this?

1934
02:30:38,171 --> 02:30:40,386
-Carpet is new one.
-Yes yes!

1935
02:30:40,584 --> 02:30:41,993
-So it's rollong up.
-Yeah.

1936
02:30:42,231 --> 02:30:43,333
-Let's spread it.

1937

1938
02:30:48,146 --> 02:30:49,990
Stay!

1939
02:30:54,447 --> 02:30:55,574
-Oh god!
-No!

1940
02:30:57,153 --> 02:30:58,233
-Oh no!
-No!

1941
02:31:00,281 --> 02:31:01,885
-Sarma!
[groans]

1942
02:31:02,935 --> 02:31:04,463
Is this hallucination too?

1943
02:31:04,822 --> 02:31:06,769
This is delusion.

1944
02:31:06,837 --> 02:31:12,847
-Oh god! We are dead Sarma!
-Oh my god!

1945
02:31:13,463 --> 02:31:16,920
-Sarma! What's this now?
-This is death illusion.

1946
02:31:17,349 --> 02:31:20,560
Sarma! We don't need any
illusion or carpets, let's go.

1947
02:31:21,711 --> 02:31:22,217
[groans]

1948
02:31:28,868 --> 02:31:29,568
Sarma!

1949
02:31:29,769 --> 02:31:31,307
-Oh!
-Ah!

1950
02:31:32,968 --> 02:31:33,817
[howling]

1951
02:31:34,773 --> 02:31:36,443
-Sarma!
-Oh god!

1952
02:31:42,017 --> 02:31:44,740
Foam bed!
- Foam bed!

1953
02:31:46,093 --> 02:31:48,709
Carpet trouble is over
but foam bed is great.

1954
02:31:48,910 --> 02:31:50,020
It's awesome!

1955
02:31:50,428 --> 02:31:51,623
-Oh man!
-Aah!

1956
02:31:52,967 --> 02:31:58,981
-Ouch!
-Ouch!

[groans]

1958
02:32:02,576 --> 02:32:03,459
Oh no!

02:32:10,359 --> 02:32:12,551
-Oh god!
-Aah!

1960
02:32:13,573 --> 02:32:18,794

02:32:32,233 --> 02:32:33,591
-Oh!
-Whoa!

1963
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:47,887
[knocks]
Sarma! Sastry! The door.

1964
02:32:49,114 --> 02:32:51,247
Hey guys! Open the door.

1965
02:32:51,713 --> 02:32:52,781
[knocks]
Oh!

1966
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:55,832
Open the door!

1967
02:32:56,464 --> 02:32:57,613
Open it... open it.

1968
02:32:59,366 --> 02:33:00,783
I know how to... wait!

1969
02:33:03,730 --> 02:33:07,744
-Oh Shiva!
-Oh Shiva!

1970
02:33:09,533 --> 02:33:12,441
Sarathy? Is it you who fell?

1971
02:33:13,026 --> 02:33:16,879
Fell? I was doing somersaults.
- Is it? Get up.

1972
02:33:17,024 --> 02:33:19,780
Why are you sitting in a corner
leaving the carpet and foam bed?

1973
02:33:20,074 --> 02:33:22,929
-Oh! That's for men like you.
-Please, go ahead.

1974
02:33:23,203 --> 02:33:24,484
Okay.

1975
02:33:26,102 --> 02:33:31,128
-Oh Shiva!
-Oh Shiva!

1976
02:33:34,689 --> 02:33:37,397
What's this?
Is it a place to keep your slippers?

1977
02:33:37,665 --> 02:33:40,333
-Do you've any sense?
-No, we didn't keep it there.

1978
02:33:40,615 --> 02:33:42,431
If not, did they come here on their own?

1979
02:33:44,751 --> 02:33:46,409
Maybe, we didn't see.

1980
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:55,107
Wow! Foam bed!

1981
02:33:55,869 --> 02:33:58,661
What a luxury!

1982
02:34:00,590 --> 02:34:04,150
Amazing! Heavenly!

1983
02:34:04,323 --> 02:34:05,695
What a great comfort!

1984
02:34:06,783 --> 02:34:08,407
Did you see the foam bed?

1985
02:34:10,083 --> 02:34:11,441
Heaven... it's heaven.

1986
02:34:34,669 --> 02:34:35,956
Oh God!

1987
02:34:37,258 --> 02:34:38,628
Just a while ago,
you laughed loud at me.

1988
02:34:38,816 --> 02:34:41,019
Now, it's nothing. Very good.

1989
02:34:45,261 --> 02:34:51,197
Oh no! Ouch! Oh God!

1990
02:35:02,075 --> 02:35:03,417
Oh God!

1991
02:35:06,383 --> 02:35:10,782
-May you be blessed with peace!
-May you be blessed with peace!

1992
02:35:18,332 --> 02:35:19,746
What brings you at this hour?

1993
02:35:21,448 --> 02:35:26,401
After meeting the bride, I'm confused.

1994
02:35:27,465 --> 02:35:29,241
I feel like cancelling this marriage.

1995
02:35:29,538 --> 02:35:33,001
Did you see? That's Krishna's magic.

1996
02:35:33,366 --> 02:35:34,800
He made Sasi to act like this

1997
02:35:35,042 --> 02:35:40,057
so that we'll cancel
this wedding ourselves.

1998
02:35:40,963 --> 02:35:42,911
Can we fall into his trap?

1999
02:35:43,739 --> 02:35:47,440
Let the marriage be over,
everything would come in line.

2000
02:35:49,412 --> 02:35:50,267
Understood, mother?

2001
02:35:50,583 --> 02:35:52,849
At the same time when I
tie the knot over there,

2002
02:35:53,027 --> 02:35:55,854
Abhimanyu should do the same
here and it is Lord Krishna's order.

2003
02:35:56,340 --> 02:35:57,715
In my brother's absence?

2004
02:35:57,759 --> 02:36:01,327
No need to doubt it,
he'll be here as well as there.

2005
02:36:01,427 --> 02:36:02,271
Omnipresent.

2006
02:36:03,155 --> 02:36:05,867
I'll go now and ruin that wedding,

2007
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:09,756
I'll be here with Balarama and others
in time to bless the new couple.

2008
02:36:09,831 --> 02:36:11,845
I'll purify our ashram, mother.

2009
02:36:11,876 --> 02:36:14,242
Do it son, I'll appreciate you.

2010
02:36:14,742 --> 02:36:16,526

For me...
For me...

2032
02:38:33,215 --> 02:38:34,779
What's your objection?
Remove the screen.

2033
02:38:35,446 --> 02:38:37,653
You mustn't say like
that, they may feel bad.

2034
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:39,472
I don't care, I'm the groom.

2035
02:38:39,718 --> 02:38:41,157
I've every right to see the bride.

2036
02:38:41,250 --> 02:38:42,990
Grandpa, father-in-law,
get the screen removed.

2037
02:38:47,223 --> 02:38:48,351
What's your problem, son?

2038
02:38:48,417 --> 02:38:50,035
Why a screen hurdle between
me and the bride?

2039
02:38:50,327 --> 02:38:50,930
Get it removed.

2040
02:38:51,485 --> 02:38:52,906
What is he saying?

2041
02:38:53,166 --> 02:38:56,875
Nothing, it's not our tradition
to hold the screen for so long.

2042
02:38:57,039 --> 02:38:57,463
That's it.

2043
02:38:57,841 --> 02:39:01,529
But I think following our
traditions in our place is justified.

2044
02:39:01,768 --> 02:39:05,641
Which ever place it may be,
let it be done as they wish.

2045
02:39:05,822 --> 02:39:08,216
That's what I'm saying. Remove the screen.

2046
02:39:11,415 --> 02:39:13,860
Wonderful, Karna!
Our boy has established our supremacy.

2047
02:39:14,318 --> 02:39:17,694
I've told you long ago that
Lakshmana has more pride than father.

2048
02:39:18,324 --> 02:39:22,273
Karna, I feel pity on
seeing Krishna's predicament.

2049
02:39:22,717 --> 02:39:25,606
It's not yet over, the worse has to come.

2050
02:39:27,710 --> 02:39:29,959
Carry on the function
according to our traditions.

2051
02:39:30,272 --> 02:39:31,534
As you say, okay.

2052
02:39:31,857 --> 02:39:34,268
First the bride and groom
must stamp each other's feet,

2053
02:39:34,344 --> 02:39:35,988
after that pressing hand.

2054
02:39:36,134 --> 02:39:38,135
Shastri, what's that nonsense?

2055
02:39:38,218 --> 02:39:44,097
My lord, you must stamp on the toe of
the bride's left leg with your right leg.

2056
02:39:44,205 --> 02:39:45,517
Well, I'm ready for it.

2057
02:39:47,016 --> 02:39:51,308
You mustn't feel so shy.
You must also do it to him.

2058
02:39:51,548 --> 02:39:54,091
What if he gets angry?

2059
02:39:55,258 --> 02:39:57,368
Why would I get angry? I'm ready for it.

2060
02:39:58,816 --> 02:40:04,785
[chanting]

2061
02:40:18,047 --> 02:40:21,875
-Now, the bride must press your toe.
-No objection.

2062
02:40:27,494 --> 02:40:33,173
Ouch! Oh my God!

2063
02:40:33,444 --> 02:40:34,697
You killed me... killed me...

2064
02:40:35,019 --> 02:40:36,929
What about you when you stamped my toe?

2065
02:40:37,782 --> 02:40:40,669
Shastri and Sharma, I have to press
the hand, right? Tell her to do it.

2066
02:40:41,119 --> 02:40:44,044
-You know to vedic science too, right?
-Yes, I do.

2067
02:40:55,849 --> 02:40:59,102
-Now, bride must press your hand.
-No need.

2068
02:40:59,153 --> 02:41:01,471
No, you mustn't say no.
Give your hand to her.

2069
02:41:05,714 --> 02:41:11,690
[bones cracking]
Ouch! Oh no!

2070
02:41:14,215 --> 02:41:17,702
-My hand!
-What do you want?

2071
02:41:18,636 --> 02:41:19,883
-I want turmeric-rice to bless.
-Turmeric rice to bless?

2072
02:41:19,891 --> 02:41:21,111
It's last in the program.

2073
02:41:22,581 --> 02:41:24,383
What's all this, Krishna?

2074
02:41:24,492 --> 02:41:26,396
Modern time youth are like that, brother.

2075
02:41:27,295 --> 02:41:31,060
Son-in-law, my daughter is little scared,

2076
02:41:31,333 --> 02:41:33,826
do it little slowly.

2077
02:41:34,573 --> 02:41:35,810
If scared, she can't be a brave wife.

2078
02:41:36,035 --> 02:41:37,560
Shastri and Sharma, continue.

2079
02:41:38,390 --> 02:41:41,563
Wow uncle! He gave a
good repartee to Krishna.

2080
02:41:44,179 --> 02:41:47,213
Keep this jaggery and cumin
seeds on the bride's head. [chanting]

2081
02:41:47,258 --> 02:41:47,760
I know.

2082
02:41:56,070 --> 02:41:57,703
[gibbers]

2083
02:41:58,021 --> 02:42:01,974
Monkey... Monkey
Father, monkey...

2084
02:42:02,083 --> 02:42:05,121
-What's this, Lakshmana?
-Monkey!

2085
02:42:05,350 --> 02:42:07,274
-What is it?
-Monkey, grandpa.

2086
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:08,367
Come with me.

2087
02:42:17,368 --> 02:42:20,585
Why are you calling
a beautiful girl as monkey?

2088
02:42:21,284 --> 02:42:22,718
Is it time to romance?

2089
02:42:23,673 --> 02:42:24,130
Go ahead.

2090
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:31,725
Keep it on her head.
[chanting]

2091
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:52,922

2092
02:43:01,443 --> 02:43:01,909
[sneezes]

2093
02:43:02,248 --> 02:43:04,123
Can't you hold it back?

2094
02:43:04,687 --> 02:43:06,406
Go ahead, finish it.
[sneezes]

2095
02:43:10,113 --> 02:43:10,619
[sneezes]

2096
02:43:12,701 --> 02:43:16,876
I think it is due to change of water.
These sneezes doesn't mean anything.

2097
02:43:17,455 --> 02:43:18,869
Carry on.

2098
02:43:19,089 --> 02:43:22,308
-Pity! Change of water.
-Pity!

2099
02:43:34,485 --> 02:43:37,201
[wedding percussions]

2100
02:43:38,198 --> 02:43:39,475
[roars]

2101
02:43:39,696 --> 02:43:44,856
Oh my God! Tiger! Tiger!
Father, tiger...

2102
02:43:45,049 --> 02:43:48,589
-What's this Lakshmana?
-Tiger...

2103
02:43:48,723 --> 02:43:51,053
-It's not tiger, he's Krishna.
-Yes, son-in-law.

2104
02:43:53,298 --> 02:43:55,703
Mother! What's this humiliation?

2105
02:43:56,027 --> 02:43:58,321
I don't know, dear.
I don't know what sin I've committed?

2106
02:43:58,775 --> 02:44:01,172
Didn't you see the groom earlier, dear?

2107
02:44:02,101 --> 02:44:05,636
Why didn't you tell me, Duryodhana?
Is your son having any mental issues?

2108
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:10,491
Forgive me, our prince is a brave warrior.

2109
02:44:10,847 --> 02:44:13,399
I'm surprised to see him so scared.

2110
02:44:13,958 --> 02:44:16,890
I think it is the work of
black magic of our enemies.

2111
02:44:17,146 --> 02:44:18,537
You know its solution, right?

2112
02:44:18,943 --> 02:44:20,847
Smear sacred ash and tie an amulet.

2113
02:44:21,849 --> 02:44:22,323
Come here.

2114
02:44:24,962 --> 02:44:30,184
-This is holy armour!
-This will protect you.

2115
02:44:30,355 --> 02:44:35,546
-This is holy armour!
-This will protect you.

2116
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:40,695
No matter what, I don't want to marry her.

2117
02:44:40,903 --> 02:44:41,888
Tiger... Tiger...

2118
02:44:42,286 --> 02:44:44,540
If you refuse,
I'll get her married to Abhimanyu.

2119
02:44:44,583 --> 02:44:47,495
-No away, I want her.
-Then, come.

2120
02:44:52,236 --> 02:44:58,235
[chanting]

2121
02:45:14,343 --> 02:45:17,088
Awe!

2122
02:45:18,739 --> 02:45:19,755
De... Devil!

2123
02:45:22,141 --> 02:45:23,913
Lakshmana...
Uncle!

2124
02:45:26,074 --> 02:45:26,550
Son...

2125
02:45:32,304 --> 02:45:36,173
Oh! Prince has fainted.

2126
02:45:36,337 --> 02:45:37,736
[screams]
Laksmana...

2127
02:45:39,207 --> 02:45:41,170
Oh! Our prince has fainted.

2128
02:45:41,475 --> 02:45:43,482
-Immediate duty?
-Get him out of it.

2129
02:45:44,072 --> 02:45:44,947
No use.

2130
02:45:45,265 --> 02:45:48,057
He'll not wake up till this
magical illusion is broken.

2131
02:45:48,986 --> 02:45:50,185
What's all this, uncle?

2132
02:45:50,766 --> 02:45:54,804
I suspected foul play when
Krishna supported this marriage.

2133
02:46:03,227 --> 02:46:04,251
Uncle... uncle...

2134
02:46:04,714 --> 02:46:07,321
Don't disturb him.
I must know the truth.

2135
02:46:07,785 --> 02:46:09,765
Sathyaki, get me the plough.

2136
02:46:10,259 --> 02:46:12,548
Calm down Balarama.

2137
02:46:13,469 --> 02:46:17,913
l swear on my dice and tell you the truth.

2138
02:46:18,370 --> 02:46:19,279
Listen.

2139
02:46:20,286 --> 02:46:23,676
We usurped kingdom of Pandavas by
cheating them in the game of dice.

2140
02:46:24,623 --> 02:46:27,600
They kept their promise
and went into exile.

2141
02:46:28,180 --> 02:46:31,036
You came rushing to punish us
on hearing this.

2142
02:46:31,190 --> 02:46:34,306
But you're a barlish innocent Yadava.

2143
02:46:35,701 --> 02:46:39,581
I know you'll easily fall for
praise and felicitation.

2144
02:46:39,872 --> 02:46:40,986
You did fall for it.

2145
02:46:41,367 --> 02:46:43,005
Though you're not equal to us,

2146
02:46:43,264 --> 02:46:45,680
do you know why we insisted on
accepting your daughter in marriage?

2147
02:46:46,231 --> 02:46:49,365
lf Pandavas attack us
after the exile period,

2148
02:46:49,630 --> 02:46:53,882
to keep you and your brother
away from joining their ranks.

2149
02:46:54,715 --> 02:47:00,218
Like as you sow so you reap,
we did got a good stick for it.

2150
02:47:01,878 --> 02:47:05,669
Krishna, these cheats shouldn't
be left with this punishment,

2151
02:47:06,189 --> 02:47:08,636
-Where's my plough?
- Brother!

2152
02:47:18,658 --> 02:47:20,446
Elder uncle, I bow to you.

2153
02:47:21,139 --> 02:47:25,152
You needn't have to strain yourself,
I'm here to finish them.

2154
02:47:26,297 --> 02:47:29,531
-Who are you?
- Me? Who am I?

2155
02:47:31,112 --> 02:47:33,646
When you were arrested by Angels,

2156
02:47:33,751 --> 02:47:37,331
Arjuna who came to release you free,

2157
02:47:37,532 --> 02:47:39,981
I'm his elder brother Bhima's son.

2158

You evil minded people!

honour by not coming out.

2164
02:48:09,096 --> 02:48:10,056
I'll teach you a lesson.

2165

Lambu and Jambu show
them your powers.

[people shrieking]

2167
02:48:30,078 --> 02:48:33,240
Duryodhana, you were arrogant
about your wealth.

2168
02:48:33,383 --> 02:48:34,995
Watch out, what happens
to your wealth.

2169
02:48:35,218 --> 02:48:36,174

02:49:41,476 --> 02:49:43,493
Cowards! I'll not kill refugees.

2176
02:49:43,626 --> 02:49:48,540

and dump them in Hastinapuram.

Krishna, I never expected
Bhima's son will be so clever.

2194
02:51:29,529 --> 02:51:30,836
By the way, where's our daughter?

2195
02:51:31,467 --> 02:51:33,375

Sasi and Abhimanyu got married
in the same fixed time in my home,

2199

you must come, bless them
and be my guests.

2200

Why are you still here? Let's go.

Sister-in-law Hidamba!
My daughter got married in your home.

place, I don't have any objections.

Subadhra,
I'm handing my daughter happily to you.

2207
02:52:27,652 --> 02:52:31,294
Whatever it is, my son is
responsible for this to happen.

2208
02:52:31,495 --> 02:52:32,472
That gives me immense happiness.

2209
02:52:32,679 --> 02:52:35,778
No mother... no.
This was Lord Krishna's blessing.
