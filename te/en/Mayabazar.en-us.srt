52
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:20,789
Well, can you aim an arrow
as skillfully as I do?

00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:23,877
Show it by shooting.
I'll shoot better than you.

Give it to me.

00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:30,662
Aunt, can you shoot as

00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,129
Why not? Come with me.

57
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,822
I'll show my skill before your mother.

58
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:36,000

When she is standing by
holding bow and arrow,

64
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:53,982

Did you see what your son is up to?

Sasi is standing with a fruit on
her head and he's aiming to hit it.

69
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,034
What would happen if arrow hits her?

70
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,026
You fear is unwarranted,
my son will never miss his target.

71
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,453
Aunt, stand without getting scared,

72
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:12,431
I'll hit your nose pin...

73
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:13,839
-...without hurting your nose.
-What?

74
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,270
Well said, my nephew.

75
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,027
Krishna, I'm telling now,

76
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:23,403
The strength of all the five Pandavas
is equal to my nephew's strength.

77
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,640
Remember that.

Subhadra

79
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:30,869
Ask what boon will brother grant
for giving birth to such a brave son.

80
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,256
Make your wish, Subhadra.
Whatever it is, I'll grant it.

81
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,528
Let Sasi become my daughter-in-law,
what else can I seek from you, brother?

82
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,435
Is it any wish, Subhadra?

83
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,850
We decided she'd your
daughter-in-law the moment she was born.

84
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,708
-What do you say Rukmini?
-Yes.

85
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:51,811
-Subhadra, are you still doubting them?
-Still having doubt?

86
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,205
Here... Sasi is your daughter-in-law.
Is it okay?

88
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,439

00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:20,760
Subhadra,

90
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:26,175
Give my special regards to Dharmaraja,
Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva,

91
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:31,174
and their mother Kunti Devi, and Draupadi.

92
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:37,542
Go carefully, Subhadra.

93
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:41,898
You might forget us due to getting carried
away in that glory after reaching there.

94
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,934
You've said it with a smile.
Such words really hurt, sister-in-law.

95
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:46,576
Forget it.

96
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,936
Why don't you stay with us, nephew?

97
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,500
No, I'll not stay.
I'm taking Sasi with me.

98
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:57,070
Good, like father like son.

99
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:58,707
Yes... Yes.

00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,847
Yeah, good! Come dear.

101
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,222
No. I'll go with him.

102
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:05,425
Let her come with us, sister-in-law.

103
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,463
You asked casually today,

104
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:10,356
But when that day comes,
you'll ask sternly

105
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:11,758
and we can't avoid sending her.

106
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,648
Well, let my daughter stay
with me till then at least.

107
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:16,557
-Come dear.
-No.

108
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,301
Satyaki, get her down.

109
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,575
-You can go later. Come down dear.
-No

110
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,413
We will come back again.
Come, get down.

111
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,045

Will you give it without telling her?

open this box privately.

himself lives in that kingdom.

Rukmini, if my brother
Krishna wasn't with them,

177
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,034
neither Indra's son nor
Indra himself could do anything.

178
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:18,696
He made Dharamaraja to finish
the Rajasuya Yagna successfully.

179
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,318
He received the highest
honour in that great assembly,

180
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,583
and destroyed evil by beheading
Shishupala who spread hate.

181
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:29,484
Krishna, it is me who
should felicitate you.

182
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:31,003
Come here.

183
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:34,739

"Is it you who called me?"

00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:16,934

my heart and agitated it?"

seems as if it is a dream"

I'm unable to understand"

"whether it is a dream or
the magic of Lord Vishnu"

"It is you"

217
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:26,008
It is the gift sent by
Abhimanyu. Did you like it, Sasi?

218
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:30,596
Why are you feeling very shy?
It was Abhimanyu you saw, right.

219
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:32,907
Did she see him?

220
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:37,804
Our daughter saw Abhimanyu.
It's really effective.

221
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,932
You too open and see it.

222
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,561
You're very excited.
You open it first.

223
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,213
Open it, sister. Come on

224
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,575
Wow! Diamonds...

225
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,770
Jewels, silks!

226
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,089
It seems like Goddess of Wealth is
everywhere. What is this?

227
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:09,370
What could it be?
Wealth is very dear to you. That's it.

228
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:12,391
I don't have any such desires,
don't know why it appeared.

229
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:14,376
It doesn't show anything simply, sister.

230
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:18,427
I think it is your desire because
you're standing close to me.

231
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:19,165
May be.

232
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:20,329
[chuckles]

233
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,447
But you won't accept the its outcome.

234
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:24,267
Try your turn.

235
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,972
I'll accept if it shows what you desire.

236
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,754
Okay, I'll do it for you.

237
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:44,675
What! Why did Duryodhana
appear? It is strange.

238
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:45,719
What's strange in it?

239
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:49,601
It is known to everyone that
Duryodhana is my favourite disciple.

240
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,072
Krishna, it's your turn.
Let's see who appears.

241
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:57,705
It is obvious that Arjuna would appear.

242
00:21:58,547 --> 00:21:59,493
Do we've to see it, brother?

243
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:02,994
Rukmini won't mind.
So, look at it Krishna.

244
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:06,925
Okay. Whoever appears to
me, don't get freezed.

245
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,831
Because I really don't
know whom I like or hate.

246
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:18,159
[laughs]

247
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,581
What! Shakuni appeared
inviting for a game of dice.

248
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:31,052
Will great men appear
for nothing, brother.

249
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,726
Don't know what game he's planning?

250
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,123
Great humiliation! Brutal cheating!

251
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:43,583
Dharmaraja conducted the
Rajasuya Yagna to humiliate me.

252
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,838
He built Mayasabha palace to undermine me.

253
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:52,034
Vassal kings bowed
before him instead of me,

254
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:54,115
and presented him with gifts and tax.

255
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:58,919
And I myself distributed those gems
studded hampers to them and became a barl.

256
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:03,850
Above all, I was laughed
at by imperious Draupadi.

257
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:09,083
Before that humiliation burns me,
I'll sacrifice my life to fire.

258
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:10,853
Arrange the pyre.

259
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:14,732
O emperor! Why are you worried
when your friend Karna is here?

260
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,030
Blow the trumpets of war.

261
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:18,480
I'll kill Pandavas and repay my gratitude.

262
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,919
Well said Karna.
That's our immediate duty.

263
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:25,583
Duryodhana, why use an axe for
something that can be clipped with a nail?

264
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:27,859
Invite Dharmaraja for the game of dice.

265
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:29,810
I'll simply play the game,

266
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:35,547
effortlessly win their
kingdom and present it to you.

267
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:38,816
Winning and losing in game
of dice is decided by God, Uncle.

268
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,158
What if we lose?

269
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:42,076
May this inauspicious
words never come true.

270
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:46,388
My dice will never lose.
Test it. Come on.

271
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,868
Dushasana, tell me your number.

272
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:51,086
Two!

273
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,352
Wow uncle!
This is our immediate duty.

274
00:23:57,209 --> 00:23:58,611
Karna, you tell now.

275
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,613
It's not heroic to hide our
strength and use contrivance.

276
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:06,306
No problem, Warrior Karna. Test my skill.

277
00:24:06,953 --> 00:24:08,041
Two again.

278
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:10,656
Wow uncle!

279
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,817
Did you see Duryodhana?

280
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:16,685
An idea in the brain and dice in hands,

281
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:19,435
With them I can bring
a complete destruction.

282
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,435
You test me too.

283
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,966
-Third time is very important.
-Okay, I'll see. Same two.

284
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:28,751
No, wait. One!

285
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:31,654
Wow uncle!

286
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:36,146
Did you see? The dice fell one
hesitantly when you asked hesitantly.

287
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:38,868
-Invite Dharmaraja immediately.
-Yes brother.

288
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:40,264
That's our immediate duty.

289
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,305
Duryodhana, one more thing,

290
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,502
Dharmaraja is impulsive gambler,
he goes berserk on losing,

291
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:54,280
you make him stake not just
kingdom but his brothers,

292
00:24:54,623 --> 00:25:00,452
himself and their wife
Draupadi too and lose them.

293
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:02,398
Now, it's your wish.

294
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:05,628
I hope you'll achieve
what you said, uncle.

295
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:09,177
Brother, uncle's idea is a cyclone.
A great cyclone!

296
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:15,324
[earthquake]

297
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,931
What's this bad omen, uncle?

298
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:31,040
Bad omen at Shakuni's place? No way!

299
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,656
This is a victory anthem for my plans.

300
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:34,868
Don't get scared.

301
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:36,648
Let all your fears vanish.

302
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:38,465
Even Lord Krishna,

303
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:41,855
who is biased in favour of the Pandavas
would understand the power of my dice.

304
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:42,574
Let's go.

305
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:58,398
[music]

306
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,261
"Did you hear this, Yashoda?"

307
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:06,300
"Did you hear this, Yashoda?"

308
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,475
"Did you hear about pranks of
your little mischief Krishna?"

309
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:22,955
"I don't know anything,
I wasn't here at all"

310
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:31,187
"What can we do about his behaviour?"

311
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:33,187
Is he the one who eats butter or mud?

312
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:38,143
"By supressing the sound of his anklets,
he enters house stealthily like a cat"

313
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:45,213
"By supressing the sound of his anklets,
he enters house stealthily like a cat"

314
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:49,790
"He brings down the pots
that are tied to the ceiling"

00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:54,450
"He brings down the pots
that are tied to the ceiling"

316
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:56,613
"And drank all the milk"

317
00:26:57,461 --> 00:26:59,020
"Ate all the curd"

318
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:01,480
"Swallowed all the butter"

319
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,622
"How can I single handedly eat them?
Does it happen anywhere?"

320
00:27:04,944 --> 00:27:09,366
"Does it happen anywhere?"

321
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:14,236
"Did you hear it, mother Yashoda?"

322
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:18,999
"Did you hear the fabricated
stories of Gopikas?"

323
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:23,330
What? See how he is blaming us.
Can he be caught even if we want to?

324
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:28,767
"When all the ladies set a plan and
were waiting at every threshold"

were waiting at every threshold"

329

"Flute was being played in another's home"

330
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,810
"Aha! Then, what?"

331
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,433
"When we went inside to
check who the thief was"

332
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:02,311
"He jumped off from there magically"

333

he entered and escaped?"

he entered and escaped?"

336
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:17,555

"Danced on the head of the snake, Kaliya
snake that poisoned the river Kalindi"

snake that poisoned the river Kalindi"

342
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:53,615
Hey Krishna... Mukunda...

343
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,543
Won't you hear my appeal for help?

344
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:09,671
"I don't have any other saviour than you"

Hey Krishna,"

00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:21,765
"Won't you see my pathetic condition?"

347
00:29:22,572 --> 00:29:24,548
-"Please listen..."
-Krishna! What is this?

348
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,158
What's this?
What happened?

349
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:32,728
What would it be?
There is no bound for Kauravas atrocities.

350
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:36,746
Not only did they take away Pandavas
kingdom in their hexed game of dice,

351
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:41,840
but also they've humiliated them
and and were sending them to exile.

352
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:44,004
What! Such an injustice?

353
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:46,473
-So evil minded!
-It is the egoistic pride of the Kauravas.

354
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,762
We shouldn't tolerate this injustice!

355
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,122
Brother, give an order.

356
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:53,109
-I'll go with our army...
-Satyaki,

357
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,577
Don't rush off.

358
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:56,506
I too won't tolerate injustice.

359
00:29:57,304 --> 00:30:00,028
Now, I'll go to Hastinapura and
teach a lesson to Kauravas,

360
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:01,925
and return the lost kingdom to Pandavas.

361
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:05,934
Duryodhana is my disciple,
he'll never go against me.

362
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:07,568
Get my chariot ready.

363
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:09,682
Come dear.

364
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:13,547
I've been fearing about
trickster, Shakuni's evil plans.

365
00:30:13,697 --> 00:30:15,537
No matter whatever someone does, it is
we who have to face the consequences.

366
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,908
Don't worry Sasi.
I'm there for them.

367
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,198
Hail King!

368
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:27,938
We've received a message about your
Guru Balarama visiting our kingdom.

369
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:34,437
Sentry, take this for
bringing good news on time.

370
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:39,224
How is it good news, Uncle? I'm scared.

371
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,998
We don't know the reason of his visit.
Moreover, he's short tempered.

372
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:44,460
No problem, Duryodhana.

373
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:47,794
Best remedy for short temper is praise.

374
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:50,370
So arrange a grand
honour to Lord Balarama.

375
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:52,235
He will be pleased with your felicitation,

376
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,460
and grant you a boon without
even having a second thought.

377
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:56,507
Take it.

378
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:03,924
Get your son Lakshmana Kumar
married with his daughter Sasirekha.

379
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:06,465
With that, Balarama will be on our side.

380
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,515
Ultimately, Yadavas will be on our side.

381
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,336
And with that, Krishna will be left
with no choice but to join our ranks.

382
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:15,683
Wow Uncle!
That's our immediate duty.

383
00:31:15,762 --> 00:31:18,963
Uncle, politically our plan is flawless,

384
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,200
but our Lakshmana Kumar
is more proud than his father.

385
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,804
Will he accept the Yadava princess?

386
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,468
Well, he will definitely accept.
That's my responsibility.

387
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:36,078
[humming]

388
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:42,057
-Sarathy
-My lord.

389
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:43,019
[whistles]

390
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:45,691
Wow! Amazing!

391
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,038
-My lord!
-Yes.

392
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:58,096
Great warrior, braveheart,
Lakshmana Kumar...

393
00:31:59,078 --> 00:32:00,605
-Enough of your praise.
-Okay.

394
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,372
My lord, hear mine.

395
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:07,767
You're life is honourable than Abhimanyu's

396
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,249
Wow! This is real poetry.

397
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,086
Here, take it.

398
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,497
Then, hear this.

399
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,145
"Being exiled into a
forest is his ill-fate,"

400
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:17,845
"Having lavish life is your good fate."

401
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:19,811
Well said.

402
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,718
Hail prince!

403
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:27,055
-My lord, you've got visitor.
-Not now.

404
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:31,979
"In the battlefield, when a
Padmavyuha (Lotus strategy) is planned,"

405
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:34,194
"Abhimanyu knows only to go forward,"

406
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,087
"But you know how to turn back."

407
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:37,132
[laughs]

408
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:37,946
-My lord!
-Shh!

409
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,308
"Has he got your brain?"

410
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,012
"Has he got your ease?"

411
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:43,637
"Has he got your mastery of art?"

412
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:46,589
-"This is not a praise"
-Ha ha.

413
00:32:46,688 --> 00:32:47,818
Sarathy... Sarathy.

414
00:32:48,196 --> 00:32:51,924
My lord, they've praised
and accepted gifts.

415
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:55,360
These blabbering poets are
nothing compared to me.

416
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:57,108
-Hear mine.
-Yes.

417
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,958
"Two that side, two this side,"

418
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:00,983
"Abhimanyu's uncles"

419
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:05,696
"From either side,
they are just four."

420
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,528
"But for you,"

421
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,988
"You've got one less of hundred uncles."

422
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:16,666
What an army of uncles you have!

423
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:21,502
-"Wonderful..."
-Well said, Sarathy.

424
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,467
Dear Lakshmana Kumara!

425
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:28,552
Oh is it you?
You all may leave now.

426
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:36,318
Wow! You look very handsome.
A romantic hero indeed.

427
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:40,090
I'll tell you good news,
come sit here.

428
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:42,867
It is the attribute of a brave
person to listen standing.

429
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:43,954
Tell me.

430
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:47,981
Look, you're the prince
of this vast kingdom.

431
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:49,284
That's all?

432
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:52,825
Not just that,
you're the prince of princes.

433
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:54,470
Young king!

434
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:56,050
Young emperor!

435
00:33:57,292 --> 00:34:02,027
Your father and I've decided
that we should get you married.

436
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,353
Then, I've decided too.

437
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:06,662
The proposal is also
from a very good family.

438
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,993
The bride is a world beauty.

439
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:12,144
Sasirekha, Balarama's daughter.

440
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,870
What a shame!

441
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:16,626
How can I become the son-in-law to
uncivilised liege king of Yadavas?

442
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:17,539
Impossible.

443
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:20,260
That's a danger.

444
00:34:20,832 --> 00:34:22,861
We've heard that Abhimanyu loves her.

445
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:25,407
What!
Is it me who can't love her?

446
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,931
I'll marry any girl Abhimanyu loves.

447
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:30,056
I'll ensure that there are no girls
left in this world for him to marry.

448
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,740
Grandpa, I want Rekha.

449
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,163
-You're smart!
-Yes.

450
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:37,762
-Then I'll fix the marriage.
-Your wish.

451
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:53,490
Hail victory to you!

452
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:55,009
Epitome of truth!

453
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,263
Protector of the refuge seekers!

454
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:57,831
Generous man!

455
00:34:57,932 --> 00:34:59,373
Saviour of the world!

456
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,325
Supreme lord of the world,
Sri Sri Balarama!

457
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:05,698
Hail victory to you!

458
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:11,907
[music]

459
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:56,056
Has he got your brain?

460
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:59,415
Has he got your ease?

461
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:02,276
Has he got your mastery of art?

462
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,146
-Who is it, Sarathy?
-You!

463
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:07,707
No... I mean Abhimanyu.

464
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:11,910
"Victory to you, O mighty warrior!"

465
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:14,525
"Victory to you, O romantic hero!"

466
00:37:14,796 --> 00:37:17,246
"Lullaby." Stop your lullaby!

467
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:18,002
Okay.

468
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:22,965
My lord, come quickly and
seek blessings from Balarama.

469
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:25,258
Shame! Taking is seeker's trait.

470
00:37:25,548 --> 00:37:27,507
-Giving is regal character.
-So be it!

471
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:32,060
My lord, if you delay like this,
you may not get Sasirekha.

472
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,546
You promised to bow to
your future father-in-law.

473
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:38,280
Not bow, I promised only to greet him.

474
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,392
-How to do it?
-It's simple, my lord.

475
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:44,681
-Fold hands like this...
-Shame! That's your habit.

476
00:37:44,715 --> 00:37:45,232
So be it.

477
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:47,568
My lord, I'll show you.

478
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,091
You've seen Dharmaraja

479
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:53,691
greeting Bhishma, Dronacharya
and your grandfather, didn't you?

480
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:55,239
And you used to laugh jeeringly at him.

481
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:58,255
Even though it is little
difficult, bend like this

482
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,377
with profound humbleness,

483
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:05,870
-Bend like this... and that's all, my lord
-I can go down further, get up.

484
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:07,124
Come.

485
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:14,777
Moreover, the game of dice was played with
Bheeshma, Drona, Vidhura's permission

486
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:16,404
and in their presence.

487
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:20,654
If there was injustice
would they keep quiet?

488
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:25,653
Yes, winning fairly in the game of
dice is equal as just as winning a war.

489
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:26,955
I too accept it.

490
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:30,556
Not only you, even Dharmaraja
himself accepted it.

491
00:38:30,794 --> 00:38:35,137
But Bhima got furious and
made vows of destruction.

492
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:40,320
Uncle, don't talk about that
blabber and hurt his feelings.

493
00:38:40,336 --> 00:38:43,030
Let him tell, shamelessly made vows too.

494
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:47,018
-What did he say?
-To kill everyone.

495
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,354
He promised to split open my chest.

496
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,684
-He promised to drink my blood.
-What did l do?

497
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:53,390
Brother's order and my duty
to follow it.

498
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,131
-And Draupadi...
-Not just her relatives,

499
00:38:57,355 --> 00:39:03,286
He was ranting that the world is on
his side and Kauravas fall is inevitable.

500
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:04,793
So I couldn't bear to hear it and said,

501
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,775
"Mighty warrior Balarama is on our side."

502
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:13,288
Then he said, "I'll break Duryodhana's
thigh as Balarama watches",

503
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:15,174
"what can that old man do,"

504
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,690
-"what can that Yadava do..."
-Aargh!

505
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:20,614
He's a rogue!
He's responsible for this enmity.

506
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,264
-It's not a sin to kill him.
-Calm down.

507
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:27,017
You're an elderly person,

508
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:28,672
who wishes for welfare of everyone,

509
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:35,537
I told you to relieve
my burden of my fear but

510
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:39,941
Guru, I don't want all
these fears and jealous,

511
00:39:40,459 --> 00:39:45,519
I'll give you the entire kingdom
that I won in the game of dice.

512
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,371
Return the kingdom to them
and bring peace between us.

513
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:53,463
Unnecessary. It is sin to give
to those who don't deserve it.

514
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:58,343
Duryodhana, I'm granting you a
boon pleased with your conduct.

515
00:39:59,038 --> 00:39:59,642
Make your wish.

516
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:03,057
Lakshmana Kumara,
you came at the right time.

517
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:03,957
Come son!

518
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,736
Touch Guru's feet and seek his blessings.

519
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:17,816
May you get married soon!

520
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,479
Duryodhana, your son is
ahead of you in humbleness.

521
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:23,166
He respects elders.

522
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:25,048
Never raises head also
before his father.

523
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:27,211
He has great devotion for you.

524
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:31,985
Those are the traits of a great people.
That will bring laurels to future kings.

525
00:40:32,756 --> 00:40:33,383
Get up son!

526
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,003
What do you want?

527
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,670
He has been yearning for many years,

528
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,303
She's doing penance to make
your daughter Sasi his queen.

529
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:46,337
-You have to fulfil his wish.
-Happily granted.

530
00:40:47,346 --> 00:40:48,013
Get up son.

531
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:52,765
Hail Lord Krishna!

532
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:58,536
Hail Subhadra Devi! Hail Abhimanyu!

533
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:05,123
Welcome Subhadra.

534
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:10,683
May you be blessed with marriage.

535
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:15,299
Are the Pandavas doing fine, brother?

536
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:18,294
Great men are fine
wherever they are.

537
00:41:23,706 --> 00:41:24,581
Are you fine, dear?

538
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:31,531
Sasi! Did you see he
has become Sathyavan?

539
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:40,257
If he's Sathyavan, then she's Savithri.

540
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:42,097
Our girl is no less.

541
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:47,146
Rukmini, can't find
sister-in-law? Is she fine?

542
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:49,708
She belongs to olden times,

543
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:52,659
She's more sad than
Pandavas for losing kingdom.

544
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:57,363
Yes. If we are happy, she
will be happy too. Come in.

545
00:41:58,573 --> 00:41:59,043
Come nephew.

546
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:05,995
I felt very pity on
seeing Subhadra, madam.

547
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,282
No grandeur of old times.

548
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:12,600
She came wearing jute sari
without any jewels.

549
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:16,051
As you sow so you reap.

550
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:17,834
-What can we do?
-Queen,

551
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:19,775
Subhadra Devi is coming.

552
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:22,755
Okay.

553
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,394
Champa, bandage my head.

554
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:38,220
[groaning]

555
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:41,053
Champa...

556
00:42:49,683 --> 00:42:55,397
[groaning]

557
00:42:57,073 --> 00:42:58,406
Come Subhadra!

558
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:00,306
Had a safe journey?

559
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:01,690
Please sit.

560
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:06,802
My bad time, I got headache when you came.

561
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:08,947
I couldn't even come to receive you.

562
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:10,949
I wanted to meet you immediately,

563
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:13,586
But brother Krishna and Rukmini
took me to their house, sister-in-law.

564
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,990
I don't mind which ever house you go to.

565
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:16,733
I don't have any such botherings.

566
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,365
Henceforth, all of us
have to stay here, right?

567
00:43:20,905 --> 00:43:21,815
These twelve years...

568
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:24,515
Wherever we reside,
we don't lack any luxury.

569
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:26,203
You don't feel sad for it.

570
00:43:26,828 --> 00:43:28,275
When is brother retuning?

571
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,390
How do I know?

572
00:43:30,018 --> 00:43:32,087
Did he inform me before
leaving to inform his arrival?

573
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:33,773
Moreover, he's a short tempered man.

574
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:37,776
I'm scared that he may
pick up a fight there.

575
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:39,176
Oh no!

576
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:44,501
Sister-in-law, you're worrying
too much. Take some rest.

577
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,430
I'll come after brother arrives.

Madam, your mother wants
to see you immediately.

604
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,271
Sasi, tomorrow is full moon day.

605
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:03,055
Don't forget about boating tour.

606
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,004
What's it mother?

607
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:19,762
Are you having headache?

608
00:47:20,327 --> 00:47:22,199
Indeed your silly acts
are giving me headaches.

609
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,498
Why were you dancing around
with him in the garden?

610
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:26,556
What's wrong if I play with him?

611
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:28,929
Are you both little children?

612
00:47:29,562 --> 00:47:30,428
You're young woman
and of marriageable age,

613
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:32,536
won't others laugh at us if you
roam with him before marriage?

614
00:47:33,122 --> 00:47:34,367
Won't the elders of the
place find fault with it?

615
00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:35,574
It'll bring bad name too.

616
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:37,307
What do you want me to do then?

617
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:40,205
I'm telling you to stop
going out with Abhimanyu.

618
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,158
Infact, don't even talk to him.

619
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,094
Follow my orders and be
my daughter. Understood?

00:48:13,103 --> 00:48:15,337
Subhadra, what happened?

624
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,581
They say never go to parents'
home after getting ruined.

625
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:24,985
After seeing elder
sister-in-law's cold reception,

626
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:28,260
I'm rethinking of my arrival here.

627
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,062
What's this, Subhadra?

628
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,875
How can you think like this
despite knowing about her attitude?

629
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:36,164
She'll change after Balarama returns.

630
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:39,191
Come, your brother is waiting for you.

631
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:53,380
Wow! This one jewel will cost 10 lakhs.

632
00:48:54,404 --> 00:48:55,867
If we have to value all these...

633
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:56,898
What's there in the value?

634
00:48:57,623 --> 00:49:00,264
This is Emperor
Duryodhana's devotion on me.

635
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:04,178
He gave me a rousing
reception and felicitated me.

636
00:49:05,205 --> 00:49:07,218
I granted him a boon
pleased with his devotion.

637
00:49:07,382 --> 00:49:08,829
What did he wish for?
What did you grant?

638
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,437
Please tell me too.

639
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:12,112
How can I not tell you?

640
00:49:12,543 --> 00:49:14,711
He asked to make Queen Revathi's daughter,

641
00:49:15,016 --> 00:49:18,971
as the queen of future
king Lakshmana Kumara.

642
00:49:19,476 --> 00:49:20,142
I said yes.

643
00:49:21,398 --> 00:49:25,612
-But I'm worried about Subhadra.
-She might think anything.

644
00:49:25,784 --> 00:49:27,976
Can we send our daughter
to forest for her sake?

645
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:30,298
As our daughter is really fortunate,

646
00:49:30,646 --> 00:49:32,310
they made a request and you promised them.

647
00:49:32,978 --> 00:49:34,569
And the burden on my heart has eased too.

648
00:49:35,488 --> 00:49:39,073
But let us keep this confidential
till the marriage date is fixed.

649
00:49:39,182 --> 00:49:40,506
-Why?
-You don't know anything,

650
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,661
Subhadra will create a
scene if she comes to know.

651
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,302
Oh! Alright.

652
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,850
Come dear... come.

653
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:48,972
Come dear... come.

654
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:53,458
Look, these gifts were
sent to you by Bhanumathi.

655
00:49:53,969 --> 00:49:56,425
-I don't want it, father.
-Don't say like that, accept it.

656
00:49:56,547 --> 00:49:58,628
Will you say no to gifts sent
by Queen Bhanumathi?

657
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,950
Who is she to send me gifts?

658
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:03,061
-Who am I to her to accept the gifts?
-Did you see her hot temper?

659
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:05,547
What's this dear?
They are also our well wishers.

660
00:50:06,018 --> 00:50:08,389
How can they be, father?
Anyway I'll not accept it.

661
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:11,016
-Sasi...
-You keep quiet, I'll cure that itch.

662
00:50:20,671 --> 00:50:23,999
What's your arrogance?
Will you walk out on your father?

663
00:50:24,364 --> 00:50:28,743
When Kaurava King sends gifts
to honour you, will you belittle them?

664
00:50:29,303 --> 00:50:30,321
I didn't belittle them.

665
00:50:30,662 --> 00:50:35,604
Those evil people sent gifts
to insult you, me and all of us.

666
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:38,516
What? Who taught all these bad ideas?

667
00:50:38,895 --> 00:50:41,366
Rukmini and Subhadra?
I don't like all this.

668
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:44,249
Don't ever go to their home
again, don't even talk to them.

669
00:50:44,463 --> 00:50:46,171
You're my daughter.

670
00:50:46,437 --> 00:50:48,450
You must obey me. Be careful.

how should I come out?

Shh! Jump, I'll catch you.

679
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,367
How am I to come up again?

680
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:17,044

with arrows. Climb down.

Stop!
I'll get you gifts.

Praising me coming to my place.

746
00:59:28,629 --> 00:59:31,570
Then what? You're the supreme lord!

747
00:59:31,678 --> 00:59:34,931
Yes... but I didn't expect you so early.

748
00:59:35,089 --> 00:59:36,179
Why should you think, brother?

749
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:39,265
You're kind hearted boon giver,
don't know what boon you granted them.

750
00:59:39,731 --> 00:59:42,359
May be he's here to remind
you, lest you may forget it.

751
00:59:42,523 --> 00:59:44,339
Why should I remind him, Krishna?

752
00:59:44,553 --> 00:59:46,879
The moment he granted
the boon we were blessed.

753
00:59:47,008 --> 00:59:49,334
Yes... Great men don't come for nothing.

754
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:50,210
Brother...

755
00:59:50,562 --> 00:59:53,946
Whatever it is, I'll not tolerate
if he plays game of dice with you.

756
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:55,990
Why are you so scared, Krishna?

757
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,465
It is obvious that your
brother will win the game of dice.

758
00:59:59,793 --> 01:00:00,977
He's epitome of honesty.

759
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:04,625
But if it is proved you're dishonest,
you'll have trouble from him.

760
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,559
It's good for you to be careful.

761
01:00:08,118 --> 01:00:09,520
Though I'm younger it
just my sweet warning.

762
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:14,477
Did you see how Krishna is
threatening with his wit?

763
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:19,692
No, whenever he meets intelligent
men like you, he gets little shaken up.

764
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:21,197
Welcome.

765
01:00:21,855 --> 01:00:22,414
Welcome.

766
01:00:24,931 --> 01:00:29,025
This auspicious time is fixed according
Lakshmana Kumar's horoscope.

767
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:32,486
The event of wedding of Sasirekha

768
01:00:33,012 --> 01:00:34,945
will be an event that world will
remember for a very long time.

769
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:38,507
The power of the
auspicious time is very strong.

770
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:41,387
You've decided the auspicious time too.

771
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,836
Of course. As soon as you said okay,

772
01:00:45,383 --> 01:00:49,224
Bheeshma, Drona and Vidhura
wanted this to happen at the earliest

773
01:00:49,565 --> 01:00:51,507
So they've sent us by fixing
this date and time of marriage.

774
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:57,091
If elders had fixed this, I'm
sure it'll be very important.

775
01:00:59,101 --> 01:01:01,301
Why are you thinking, brother? Go ahead.

776
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:02,093
So be it.

777
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,058
I think our priests are checking
for the best auspicious dates.

778
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,052
Wow! Great astrologers!

779
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:15,793
They are very renowned astrologers.

780
01:01:17,962 --> 01:01:21,458
There's nothing to think
about this auspicious time.

781
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:23,367
And even there is nothing
doubtful about this auspicious time.

782
01:01:23,623 --> 01:01:24,723
But still,

783
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:28,098
We're checking planetary movements
according to the bride's horoscope.

784
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:34,776
Shukracharya,
the guru of demons is casting a bad eye.

785
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:39,513
This may create problems and difficulties
in the lives of the newly weds.

786
01:01:39,752 --> 01:01:45,740
Yes, astrology always says
right and bitter truths only.

787
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,182
We must take only
the gist of it lightly.

788
01:01:50,096 --> 01:01:55,644
You've to take problem
here as love problem.

789
01:01:55,974 --> 01:02:01,025
Difficulties here mean many children.

790
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:04,341
But this is bad time.

791
01:02:04,775 --> 01:02:08,174
Astrology says marriage
in these times is impossible.

792
01:02:08,428 --> 01:02:12,252
You need to be presented
for your scholarliness.

793
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:15,282
But your astrology works
for ordinary people only,

794
01:02:15,643 --> 01:02:18,946
not for Kauravas who are
brilliant and fortunate men.

795
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:23,678
May be but when Saturn is in this room...

796
01:02:23,879 --> 01:02:24,649
[chuckles]

797
01:02:24,832 --> 01:02:28,804
Our Shakuni who is equal
to a lakh Saturns is here,

798
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:30,428
so why bother in which room the Saturn is?

799
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:33,580
Accept it. It's their tradition.

800
01:02:35,235 --> 01:02:39,100
Brother, their haste is ours too.

801
01:02:39,724 --> 01:02:42,416
I too agree for this proposal
and the time fixed by them.

802
01:02:43,085 --> 01:02:44,877
Only if you think we don't
have much time.

803
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:50,379
Krishna, when you're taking all
the responsibility in your hands,

804
01:02:51,577 --> 01:02:54,779
The time will never run short.
I don't have that fear.

805
01:02:55,558 --> 01:02:58,021
Alright. We shall fix
the wedding at this time.

806
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,681
Amazing!
Sasirekha madam is very fortunate.

807
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:19,236
She's going to wed Prince,
Lakshmana Kumara

808
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:21,946
and become the daughter-in-law
of Queen Bhanumati...

809
01:03:22,224 --> 01:03:23,615
-Champa
-Madam.

810
01:03:29,354 --> 01:03:32,303
Be careful.
Mind your words. Get lost.

[metal vessel tumbles]

812
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,475
What's this barlishness, Sasi?

813
01:03:47,225 --> 01:03:50,746
How humiliated I would be if
people come to know your attitude?

814
01:03:54,028 --> 01:03:57,324
I plead you. Get groomed and come now.

815
01:03:57,981 --> 01:03:59,700
Grandpa Shakuni will bless you.

816
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:03,208
I don't want any blessings.
I'm not interested in this wedding at all.

817
01:04:03,285 --> 01:04:06,261
Don't you say that. It is the
proposal which matches our status.

818
01:04:06,707 --> 01:04:08,301
And it is the wealth which came for us.

819
01:04:08,868 --> 01:04:11,251
Your dad gave his word to the
emperor for the welfare of you.

820
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,010
Even your Uncle,
Krishna accepted this proposal.

821
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:15,301
It is a lie. Everything is a lie.

822
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,971
Your uncle himself sat with
them and approved the proposal.

823
01:04:18,597 --> 01:04:20,173
Let me ask him to say that to you.

824
01:04:20,426 --> 01:04:22,813
-I don't want anyone to tell me anything.
-My Queen

825
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,529
Subhadra and Rukhmini have arrived.

826
01:04:25,766 --> 01:04:27,357
Everyone was holding grudge on me.

827
01:04:27,811 --> 01:04:28,710
What sin did I commit?

828
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:35,482
Is it justice to break a promise of making
Sasi my daughter-in-law, brother?

829
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:39,080
Is it breaking a promise?
He told it just like that to his sister.

830
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:42,718
Will it be same as granting a boon
to emperor Duryodhana in his court?

831
01:04:43,335 --> 01:04:47,394
Not only that, you're making a
wedding alliance with of our enemies.

832
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:49,411
Did you think it's a great insult to me?

833
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,850
How my husband his
brothers look down upon me?

834
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,344
If you think there would be such
treatment, then don't go there at all.

835
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,013
There's nothing short
in your respect here.

836
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:02,526
Enough of your respect for me, brother.
I'm telling you the last time,

837
01:05:03,219 --> 01:05:05,801
If Sasi doesn't become my daughter-in-law,
I'll not stay here even for a moment.

838
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:07,393
Is this how you're going to threaten us?

839
01:05:07,918 --> 01:05:11,225
Do you want my daughter also
to be in parents' home like you?

840
01:05:12,987 --> 01:05:17,713
Sister, leave about Subhadra.
Think about our daughter.

841
01:05:18,487 --> 01:05:20,403
It is we who filled her
thoughts since childhood.

842
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:24,245
Sasi hopes that Abhimanyu
will become her husband.

843
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,575
If you marry her to someone else,
what will become of her life?

844
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,578
Do you know about a daughter more than me?

845
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,496
You would know had you
given birth to a daughter.

846
01:05:31,624 --> 01:05:32,411
Would you say these morals then?

847
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,395
Revathi, keep quiet.

848
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:38,632
Whatever it is, this wedding
would be conducted as scheduled.

849
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:41,306
I don't want anyone
to stop or threaten me.

850
01:05:41,941 --> 01:05:42,941
Surely you do, brother.

851
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:45,716
You're ruining two young
people's lives cosnciously.

852
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:47,926
I didn't think you'll be so obstinate.

853
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:50,835
Making your sibling sad
wouldn't just go waste.

854
01:05:51,499 --> 01:05:55,231
May be you think wealth of Kauravas
is greater than courage of Pandavas.

855
01:05:55,508 --> 01:05:56,232
It will never be true.

856
01:05:56,547 --> 01:05:59,026
Are you threatening me with
their bravery, Subhadra?

857
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:04,362
Their bravery doesn't need me,
my disciple Duryodhana is enough.

858
01:06:05,035 --> 01:06:09,121
Even 1000 Bhimas and 1000 Arjunas
are nothing compared to him.

859
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:14,241
Uncle, mind your tongue.
Though my father is not present, I'm here.

860
01:06:15,261 --> 01:06:17,104
-What will you do?
-What will I do?

861
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:21,215
Abhimanyu, will you bring an insult
to me by going against your uncle?

862
01:06:21,597 --> 01:06:24,992
This is not a mutiny.
I'm standing bravely on my ground.

863
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:29,567
Uncle, if Kauravas are
as brave as you say,

864
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:31,978
tell them to come along
with Lakshmana Kumara,

865
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,679
I'll drive out Duryodhana,
Dushyasana, Karna and Shakuni,

866
01:06:35,188 --> 01:06:38,343
and their armies to Hastinapuram,

867
01:06:38,647 --> 01:06:41,011
I'll take Sasi as my wife
in open competition.

868
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:44,167
If you and your friends have the courage,
announce a Swayamvara.

869
01:06:44,479 --> 01:06:46,038
You'll know who Sasi belongs to.

870
01:06:46,804 --> 01:06:49,208
Abhimanyu,
why are you throwing challenges?

871
01:06:50,121 --> 01:06:51,937
If you are really a brave man,

872
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:55,253
would you stand here and throw challenges?

873
01:07:02,684 --> 01:07:06,347
Subhadra, you're a brave
wife and a brave mother.

874
01:07:06,784 --> 01:07:08,255
I didn't expect you to be so weak.

875
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,707
You understood Balarama's intentions,
right? Why do you still make a scene?

876
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,298
There is no one here to
to listen to your appeals.

877
01:07:16,392 --> 01:07:17,810
You can go wherever you feel like.

878
01:07:18,695 --> 01:07:19,935
Sure, brother.

879
01:07:21,783 --> 01:07:26,216
The day when you honour
bravery but not wealth,

880
01:07:26,682 --> 01:07:28,354
I'll step here again only on that day.

881
01:07:30,288 --> 01:07:30,995
Aunt!

882
01:07:31,949 --> 01:07:34,096
-Aunt!
-Where are you going, Sasi?

883
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:37,258
-I'll also go with aunt.
-When I'm still alive?

884
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:39,534
Don't get smart with me.
Come.

885
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,811
-Aunt.
-Sasi, what's this?

886
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:53,015
Dharuka,

887
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,139
Subhadra and Abhimanyu
are leaving to Dwaithavanam.

888
01:07:59,464 --> 01:08:03,048
But you've to take them to Ghatotkacha's
ashram without informing them.

889
01:08:03,188 --> 01:08:03,690

This is right way.
We've entered it knowingly.

1007
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:23,853
Or shall we go back?

1008

Turning back is not our way. Go ahead.

1009

What do you call their enemies Kauravas?

1033
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:04,988
Anti frendz... Anti frendz.

1034
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:06,837
You and your brain!

1035
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:10,204
My lord, he has produced a new
word foe as antonym of friend.

1036
01:18:10,454 --> 01:18:13,122
Yes, how words develop
without anyone producing it.

1037
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,363
-Award him with two!
-Two? Okay put!

1038
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:24,408
Chinamaya,

1039
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:29,680
teach them what you call Duryodhana,
Dushyasana, Karna and Shakuni together.

1040
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:33,477
Well, Bad quartet! Repeat it!

1041
01:18:33,778 --> 01:18:35,077
Yes. Ba...

1042
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,181
Come on, say it! Bad quartet!

1043
01:18:40,694 --> 01:18:42,087
Bada quarateet!

1044
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:47,234
-Badaa quaraateete!
-Oh my God! Oh my God!

1045
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:50,186
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1046
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:51,226
-Shh!
-Shh!

1047
01:18:51,696 --> 01:18:54,324
-It's wrong to split a word.
-Why is it wrong?

1048
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:58,576
We must split and kill those
quartet like they pronounce.

1049
01:18:59,934 --> 01:19:02,827
Oh my God! Oh my God!
[laughs]

1050
01:19:03,263 --> 01:19:07,474
My lord...
[groans]

1051
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:12,435
Some human busted me.

1052
01:19:13,263 --> 01:19:14,985
He's young and tempered.

1053
01:19:16,019 --> 01:19:17,620
Human? A young man?

1054
01:19:18,361 --> 01:19:19,020
Strange! Strange!

1055
01:19:20,187 --> 01:19:21,302
-Hey Rambu
-Yes, my lord.

1056
01:19:21,559 --> 01:19:22,780
-Hey Jambu
-Yes, my lord.

1057
01:19:22,978 --> 01:19:26,095
I can't tolerate this any more.
Finish him with your magical powers.

1058
01:19:26,598 --> 01:19:28,254
-We'll knock him down and...
-And bring him to you.

1059
01:19:28,595 --> 01:19:30,018
-bring his dead body, my lord.
-Go now.

1060
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:31,604
Wait!

1061
01:19:33,664 --> 01:19:37,063
I feel like seeing the young warrior.
Bring him alive.

1062
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:38,115
What do you say, Chinamaya?

1063
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:39,973
Go!

1064
01:19:43,622 --> 01:19:45,945
[demonic spell]

1065
01:20:06,918 --> 01:20:09,062
I'll spread from that side,
you spread from that side.

1066
01:20:10,356 --> 01:20:11,404
[demonic spell]

1067
01:20:22,616 --> 01:20:23,740
What's this danger, Dharuka?

1068
01:20:26,241 --> 01:20:28,114
Forest fire!
It's coming fast towards us!

1069
01:20:29,415 --> 01:20:35,362
Go back or seek refuge.

1070
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:40,531
Looks like it's illusion!

1071
01:20:55,343 --> 01:20:58,459
-What do we do now?
-This is a wind missile!

1072
01:21:03,973 --> 01:21:08,677
[groaning]

1073
01:21:08,975 --> 01:21:14,945
[guffaws]

1074
01:21:21,227 --> 01:21:23,557
[guffaws]

1075
01:21:30,196 --> 01:21:32,361
Hail young hero! I appreciate you!

1076
01:21:32,885 --> 01:21:37,164
Your courage has moved me.
You are very enchanting.

1077
01:21:37,624 --> 01:21:40,991
Atlast you've gathered
courage and stood before me.

1078
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:43,817
I'm also very happy. Come.

1079
01:21:44,197 --> 01:21:48,006
Hey boy! Your innocent face is
cooling my anger.

1080
01:21:48,312 --> 01:21:49,963
Your are a match to fight me.

1081
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,947
Tell your name and seek refuge,
you'll become my associate.

1082
01:21:54,263 --> 01:21:56,662
Are you a warrior who
pleads on seeking refuge?

1083
01:21:57,257 --> 01:21:59,501
I'll make you seek refuge.
Watch out!

1084
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:05,071
Aargh! You really hurt me!

1085
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:11,126
But I don't feel like hitting back, boy!

1086
01:22:12,497 --> 01:22:15,081
Tell that you are incapable.

1087
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:19,291
You can't just call me as a boy
and claim yourself to be an elder.

1088
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:20,465
Show me your power.

1089
01:22:25,136 --> 01:22:29,897
I'm not getting enraged no matter how much
you provoke me. I feel pity about you boy.

1090
01:22:30,693 --> 01:22:35,376
O mother, ask your son to tell
his name and save his life.

1091
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:39,446
-Son! Tell him your name.
-Impossible!

1092
01:22:39,857 --> 01:22:41,241
Scared of enemy and tell my name? No way!

1093
01:22:41,696 --> 01:22:42,512
Hey demon king!

1094
01:22:43,077 --> 01:22:45,462
Unable to win over me,
you've made this evil proposal.

1095
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,808
You're cunning, coward,

1096
01:22:48,008 --> 01:22:50,118
-you don't have any pride.
-Hey! What's your arrogance?

1097
01:22:50,352 --> 01:22:53,829
You're going against me as if you're
here to test my power. Watch out!

1098
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,133
[guffaws]

1099
01:22:59,636 --> 01:23:04,094
-Oh! He made our leader lose his mace.
-Oh! Suprising!

1100
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:12,303
[guffaws]

1101
01:23:40,718 --> 01:23:41,156
[bangs]

1102
01:23:57,847 --> 01:23:58,348
[bangs]

1103
01:24:12,696 --> 01:24:14,234
[bangs]

1104
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:28,827
[bangs]

1105
01:24:44,269 --> 01:24:44,929
[bangs]

1106
01:24:47,005 --> 01:24:47,491
Aargh!

1107
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:15,832
[thud]

1108
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:22,152
Abhimanyu... Abhimanyu!
My son.

1109
01:25:22,223 --> 01:25:23,285
He's just unconscious, madam.

1110
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:26,193
Ensure the demon not attacks
again before he regains conscious.

1111
01:25:31,331 --> 01:25:37,332
"I'm Lord Krishna's sister
who rules over heaven and hell"

1112
01:25:41,081 --> 01:25:47,076
"I'm Arjuna's wife who is the
mightiest warrior with magical arrows"

1113
01:25:49,815 --> 01:25:53,055
"May this arrow kill the enemy"

1114
01:25:53,343 --> 01:25:57,812
and protect the heir of Pandavas

1115
01:25:59,779 --> 01:26:01,238
Forgive me mother, I seek your refuge.

1116
01:26:02,472 --> 01:26:03,771
It's an unwittingly committed mistake.

1117
01:26:04,397 --> 01:26:06,692
Please forgive me, mother.
It's an unwittingly committed mistake.

1118
01:26:07,033 --> 01:26:09,635
I'm Bhimasena's son, Ghatotkacha.

1119
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:10,996
-Is it?
-Yes, mother.

1120
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:13,577
It's an unwittingly committed mistake.
Please forgive me.

1121
01:26:16,321 --> 01:26:18,994
-Hey demon! Wherever you may be...
-Well...

1122
01:26:19,581 --> 01:26:21,037
Victory be yours brother!

1123
01:26:21,328 --> 01:26:23,097
I'm here under the
protection of mother.

1124
01:26:23,697 --> 01:26:26,449
Abhimanyu, he's your
elder brother Ghatotkacha.

1125
01:26:26,477 --> 01:26:27,422
-Huh?
-Yeah!

1126
01:26:27,799 --> 01:26:29,860
-Hi elder brother!
-Hi younger brother!

1127
01:26:33,357 --> 01:26:35,180
It is surprising!

1128
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:40,150
I'm very elated, mother.
Extremely elated.

1129
01:26:40,245 --> 01:26:42,589
You've made a rare visit
to us. Got you at last.

1130
01:26:42,763 --> 01:26:43,796
I'll not leave you.

1131
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,943
Son, I told you not to wage
any war. What's this commotion?

1132
01:26:48,521 --> 01:26:50,535
Who are these humans?
Why are you arresting them?

1133
01:26:51,093 --> 01:26:52,927
Not arresting but hosting, mother.

1134
01:26:53,715 --> 01:26:54,973
Do you know who she is?

1135
01:26:55,194 --> 01:26:59,613
She's queen of uncle Arjuna!
Subhadra Devi!

1136
01:26:59,935 --> 01:27:02,667
-Sister Hidambi.
-May God bless you, sister.

1137
01:27:02,868 --> 01:27:06,329
I'm seeing you for the
first time. Is he your son?

1138
01:27:06,645 --> 01:27:07,681
Yes, mother.

1139
01:27:08,383 --> 01:27:09,915
God bless you, son.

1140
01:27:09,947 --> 01:27:10,637
God bless you.

1141
01:27:11,285 --> 01:27:12,416
-Hey Rambu
-Yes, my lord.

1142
01:27:12,523 --> 01:27:13,668
-Hey Jambu
-Yes, my lord.

1143
01:27:14,115 --> 01:27:14,987
They are our friends!

1144
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,431
frendz.

1145
01:27:18,094 --> 01:27:19,027
Bow to them!

1146
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:23,443
Frendz.

1147
01:27:24,994 --> 01:27:28,498
-Madam Subhadra, I'll take leave now.
-See you.

1148
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:30,637
-Hey Rambu
-Yes, my lord.

1149
01:27:30,729 --> 01:27:31,911
-Hey Jambu
-Yes, my lord.

1150
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:33,404
Our friends must be
given a grand reception.

1151
01:27:34,146 --> 01:27:36,368
Arrange songs, dance and music!

1152
01:27:37,004 --> 01:27:37,763
Come... come.

1153
01:27:38,646 --> 01:27:39,116
Mother...

1154
01:27:41,354 --> 01:27:41,785
Brother...

1155
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:46,242
Elders... Elders!

1156
01:27:46,483 --> 01:27:50,405
Why should we these
elders with us for the wedding?

1157
01:27:51,225 --> 01:27:54,295
Drona, Ashwathama and
Kripacharya are not even our relatives.

1158
01:27:54,637 --> 01:27:56,337
I struck off their names
at the begininng itself, brother.

1159
01:27:56,578 --> 01:27:59,940
Bheeshma and Vidhura are our grandfathers
amd we belong to their lineage.

1160
01:28:00,311 --> 01:28:02,704
Lord Krishna will definitely
ask why they haven't come.

1161
01:28:03,394 --> 01:28:05,169
What will be your reply, uncle?

1162
01:28:05,355 --> 01:28:08,768
What should we answer?
They are still on Pandavas side.

1163
01:28:08,872 --> 01:28:13,059
Hence, let's them that old men
are paralyzed or can't move.

1164
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:15,664
Well said, Karna.
I struck off the oldies too.

1165
01:28:17,377 --> 01:28:21,436
By striking off all the names and if it is
just four of us who attends the wedding,

1166
01:28:21,693 --> 01:28:23,228
How could it be any glory?

1167
01:28:24,046 --> 01:28:28,814
Not just four of us, Duryodhana. All
your brothers would attend the marriage

1168
01:28:29,071 --> 01:28:32,269
All the hundred brothers are
enough, it will be very grand,

1169
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:34,207
and we would can keep our word too.

1170
01:28:34,465 --> 01:28:36,855
Well said Uncle!
Then, what is our immediate duty?

1171
01:28:37,051 --> 01:28:38,011
Travel preparations.

1172
01:28:38,774 --> 01:28:40,500
Hail lord!

1173
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:45,234
The grandfather must come
immediately to Lakshmana's room.

1174
01:28:45,474 --> 01:28:48,991
Uncle, go immediately.
He may've created a new problem.

1175
01:28:50,006 --> 01:28:53,031
No need, he himself is here.
Come son.

1176
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:58,681
Character of youth!

1177
01:28:59,862 --> 01:29:03,530
You'll have a feeling of
socializing as your wedding is fixed.

1178
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,788
Yes grandpa, I don't have any stage fear.

1179
01:29:06,025 --> 01:29:07,877
I'm came here because
I can speak in public.

1180
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:09,236
I don't want to get married.

1181
01:29:09,437 --> 01:29:10,743
-What?
-Yes, father.

1182
01:29:11,073 --> 01:29:14,076
It's not bravery
without seeing the bride.

1183
01:29:15,304 --> 01:29:17,420
I was expecting this, Duryodhana.

1184
01:29:17,672 --> 01:29:21,196
Our boy forgot about this
respecting our decision.

1185
01:29:21,911 --> 01:29:22,852
Yes, now I remembered it.

1186
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:27,754
Yes, grandson.
Princes like you must go and see any girl,

1187
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:31,466
if you find them beautiful,
you should even fight Gods and win them.

1188
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:31,982
Indeed.

1189
01:29:32,314 --> 01:29:35,102
Abhimanyu may hesitate but you wouldn't.

1190
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,920
Let's go to Dwaraka immediately,

1191
01:29:38,021 --> 01:29:39,214
Upon reaching the bride's house,

1192
01:29:39,455 --> 01:29:41,643
I'll call the bride and you can meet her.

1193
01:29:42,753 --> 01:29:44,091
I'm sure you will like her.

1194
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:47,057
Even if I don't like,
I must meet the bride before our wedding.

1195
01:29:47,223 --> 01:29:48,026
That's my vow!

1196
01:29:48,991 --> 01:29:52,680
-Alright, grandson. Get ready to travel.
-I'm always ready to travel.

1197
01:29:56,284 --> 01:29:59,956
[applaud]

1198
01:30:02,056 --> 01:30:02,809
-Son
-Mother

1199
01:30:03,166 --> 01:30:04,307
What's this senseless dancing?

1200
01:30:04,408 --> 01:30:06,471
Arrange a play that preaches moral.

1201
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:07,356
I'll appreciate you.

1202
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:10,811
You heard my mother's order,
right Chinamaya?

1203
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:13,686
Yes. We have the story
of Mohini- Bhasmasura,

1204
01:30:13,911 --> 01:30:19,037
which preaches the moral about consquences
of granting boon to evil persons.

1205
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:21,908
I'll arrange it. See and enjoy.

Sasi...

1210
01:35:45,952 --> 01:35:48,215
It's me! Open the door.

1211
01:35:49,532 --> 01:35:51,142
They came to get you dressed as a bride,

1212
01:35:51,561 --> 01:35:53,233
Why did you send them
out and closed the door?

1213
01:35:53,816 --> 01:35:54,524
Why don't you talk to me?

1214
01:35:55,513 --> 01:35:56,083
Open the door.

1215
01:35:56,951 --> 01:35:59,764
How many times do I've to tell you?
I don't like this marriage.

1216
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:05,517
Sasi, there is nothing to do
with your consent or mine.

1217
01:36:05,844 --> 01:36:07,515
Don't think your protests
will cancel this marriage.

1218
01:36:07,888 --> 01:36:08,893
The groom's family is coming.

1219
01:36:09,387 --> 01:36:11,578
Your objections will not
be accepted. Be careful.

1220
01:36:12,023 --> 01:36:13,340
Get through it happily.

1221
01:36:14,622 --> 01:36:15,848
Happily?

1222
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:19,341
You dashed my hopes, broke my heart,

1223
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:23,067
and spoilt my mind.
Infact I don't want to live at all.

1224
01:36:23,167 --> 01:36:25,350
What are you saying, Sasi?

1225
01:36:25,964 --> 01:36:26,531
What happened, sister?

1226
01:36:26,692 --> 01:36:29,650
What could it be? Your ideas which you've
pitched into her mind since childhood,

1227
01:36:29,684 --> 01:36:30,694
are taking toll on me now.

1228
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:33,276
Don't get angry, sister-in-law.
She is just a little girl.

1229
01:36:33,656 --> 01:36:37,176
Give her little time to calm down.

1230
01:36:37,508 --> 01:36:41,237
You will see her excited and
enthusiastic by tomorrow.

1231
01:36:41,246 --> 01:36:44,108
Whatever, Krishna. I'm always optimistic
because you solve all the things.

1232
01:36:44,858 --> 01:36:48,291
It's your responsibility to conduct
this marriage without any hitch.

1233
01:36:55,174 --> 01:36:57,881

What?

1268
01:40:36,342 --> 01:40:38,018
He gave his word to get
Sasi married to Abhimanyu,

1269
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:41,907
And he's he shamlessly breaking it to
get her married to Duryodhana's son?

1270
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:45,204
How could Balarama being
your own brother insult you?

1271
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,911
What can we do now, sister?
We lost all our wealth, right?

1272
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,716
You just lost wealth not courage.
How can he even think like that?

1273
01:40:52,597 --> 01:40:55,355
How can the wealth worshippers
see courage, sister?

1274
01:40:56,070 --> 01:41:00,915
He even insulted by saying 'The Pandavas
are nothing compared to Kauravas'

1275
01:41:01,008 --> 01:41:02,310
Hey Rambu.
Hey Jambu.

1279
01:41:10,436 --> 01:41:14,337
My dear associates,
get ready with your armies and weapons.

1280
01:41:14,535 --> 01:41:15,884
We are going to war now.

1281
01:41:15,926 --> 01:41:20,258
Hail leader!

1282
01:41:20,851 --> 01:41:23,374
Whom are you waging a war against,
brother? I'll also join you.

1283
01:41:23,609 --> 01:41:26,103
Why do you toil when I'm there, brother?
My dear associates...

1284
01:41:26,303 --> 01:41:28,733
Son... Son!

1285
01:41:29,581 --> 01:41:33,088
I heard you, mother.
Not only did he break the promise,

1286
01:41:33,181 --> 01:41:38,313
but joined hands with those evil Kauravas
and belittled my world famous father.

1287
01:41:38,538 --> 01:41:41,978
These Yadavas are very proud and arrogant!

1288
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:44,043
I'll avenge them by

1289
01:41:44,252 --> 01:41:48,688
wiping off both the Yadavas and
the Kauravas together in one go.

Hail leader!

1297
01:42:19,696 --> 01:42:23,767
Son, it is the same if either of you
wages the war against my brother.

1298
01:42:23,853 --> 01:42:25,050
Won't it bring a bad name to me?

1299
01:42:25,744 --> 01:42:30,197
Then, I'll go to Hastinapuram
and finish at least Kauravas.

1300
01:42:30,278 --> 01:42:33,533
You can't kill them, son.
Your father has made vows.

1301
01:42:33,743 --> 01:42:35,617
The Kauravas must live to die
in the hands of the Pandavas.

1302
01:42:35,933 --> 01:42:37,604
Did you see, brother?

1303
01:42:37,798 --> 01:42:40,851
Our mothers' words have
made our strengths useless.

1304
01:42:42,059 --> 01:42:44,630
Follow my orders, son.
I'll appreciate you.

1305
01:42:45,268 --> 01:42:46,204
Go to Dwaraka,

1306
01:42:46,525 --> 01:42:48,619
use your magical powers
and bring Sasirekha here.

1307
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:50,338
I'll get her married to him.

1308
01:42:50,852 --> 01:42:53,422
Good, your order will be
implemented, mother.

1309
01:42:53,466 --> 01:42:54,302
I'll go immediately.

1310
01:42:54,985 --> 01:42:57,958
-My dear associates!
-Hail leader!

1311
01:42:58,658 --> 01:42:59,878
-Son!
-Mother!

1312
01:43:00,221 --> 01:43:04,656
I'll let you go only if you promise,
not to hurt or harm anyone there.

1313
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:07,788
-My brother, Sri Krishna...
-Is he a friend?

1314
01:43:07,819 --> 01:43:09,188
My respects to him.

1315
01:43:09,396 --> 01:43:14,312
-Upon reaching there, meet him...
-Not just meeting, worship him.

1316
01:43:14,453 --> 01:43:15,582
He'll be pleased.

1317
01:43:15,892 --> 01:43:19,042
-He will tell you the plan.
-So be it.

1318
01:43:19,258 --> 01:43:21,042
Hail mother!

1319
01:43:23,883 --> 01:43:27,420
Hey Brother! You shall protect
them till I come back return.

1320
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:29,160
As you say, brother.

How am I to find Sasirekha among
them? How can I identify her?

1328
01:45:36,927 --> 01:45:38,277
I came without knowing any details.

1329
01:45:41,155 --> 01:45:44,594

Your enlightment is good, but
tell me who you really are?

-Yes.

Don't you know who I am?

That's why I'm asking, right?

1355
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:14,823
An ignorant person will
not learn even if taught.

Hey grandpa! Stop your argument.

1357
01:47:17,124 --> 01:47:18,377
I don't care who you may be,

1358
01:47:19,598 --> 01:47:23,254
Just tell me,
where can I find Sasirekha?

1359
01:47:24,714 --> 01:47:26,807
What! Asking my help and shouting at me.

1360
01:47:27,137 --> 01:47:30,456
Tell me your name and seek
refuge humbly. I'll show you.

Hey grandpa! Who do you think I'm?
Be careful.

I can't hold my anger long,

1363
01:47:34,785 --> 01:47:36,558
I'll drown you and your
Dwaraka in the ocean.

1364

Wow! Are you very powerful?

1365
01:47:39,685 --> 01:47:40,746
Why don't you tell me that?

1366
01:47:41,153 --> 01:47:44,127
You needn't do such great things,

1367
01:47:44,183 --> 01:47:49,801
I'm old and can't walk.
Carry me, I'll show you Sasirekha.

01:47:49,936 --> 01:47:53,150
That's better. Get up!

1369
01:47:53,427 --> 01:47:58,139
"May God bless you!"

1370
01:47:58,881 --> 01:48:03,820
"May God bless you!"

1371
01:48:08,975 --> 01:48:09,746
You're so heavy!

1372
01:48:10,459 --> 01:48:13,674
You threatened to drown Dwaraka.
Can't you carry me?

1373
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:23,416
[chuckles]

1374
01:48:23,751 --> 01:48:25,216
Carry me son... carry me.

1375
01:48:31,286 --> 01:48:34,346
Did you eat elephants for dinner?
What's the magic?

1376
01:48:34,447 --> 01:48:36,363
"Big illusion will envelop smaller one"

1377
01:48:36,604 --> 01:48:38,742
"That'll vanish.
This will vanish."

1378
01:48:39,151 --> 01:48:41,062
"I'm there on the other side.
It's me even in here"

1379
01:48:41,235 --> 01:48:42,917
"I'm everything"

1380
01:48:43,219 --> 01:48:48,023
Oh! I got it! I bow before you!

1381
01:48:51,552 --> 01:48:54,862
I bow before you, Lord Krishna!

1382
01:48:55,022 --> 01:48:58,622
Bless you!

1383
01:48:59,197 --> 01:49:01,611
I'm blessed, waiting for your order.

1384
01:49:03,983 --> 01:49:06,118
Your next duty is...

1385
01:49:07,265 --> 01:49:10,505
Tranfigure yourself as Sasirekha
and get married to Lakshmana Kumara.

1386
01:49:11,025 --> 01:49:12,537
Teach the Kauravas a lesson.

1387
01:49:14,086 --> 01:49:15,786
Divine instruction!

1388
01:49:16,136 --> 01:49:16,622
Myna,

1389
01:49:19,045 --> 01:49:21,527
From now, you're his favourite maid.

1390
01:49:22,483 --> 01:49:23,150
No problem.

1391
01:49:25,915 --> 01:49:27,947
-Can I take leave now?
-Be careful, nephew.

1392
01:49:29,344 --> 01:49:31,209
Myna, show me the way to my harem.

1393
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:09,775
Madam Sairekha...
Madam Sasirekha...

1394
01:50:24,184 --> 01:50:29,783
Hail Lord Krishna!
Hail Lord Krishna!

1395
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:34,222
Hail mother!

1396
01:50:34,303 --> 01:50:36,774
Wow! What a beauty!

1397
01:50:36,782 --> 01:50:38,056
Your daughter-in-law is very beautiful.

1398
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:42,441
-You didn't make a mess there, right son?
-No mother... not at all.

1399
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,323
Everything went off peacefully.

1400
01:50:45,792 --> 01:50:48,045
Lord Krishna's blessings, mother.

1401
01:50:48,861 --> 01:50:52,043
I've to go back,
host the Kauravas,

1402
01:50:52,068 --> 01:50:55,514
And marry Lakshmana Kumara.

1403
01:50:56,055 --> 01:50:57,486
-You?
-Yes mother, I have to.

1404
01:50:59,456 --> 01:51:01,987
Sister-in-law is waking up.
I'll take leave.

1405
01:51:06,403 --> 01:51:10,381
Dashed my hopes and spoilt my mind.

1406
01:51:12,092 --> 01:51:14,007
I don't want to live.

1407
01:51:14,515 --> 01:51:19,474
-Sasi... Sasi...
-Poor girl is still lamenting.

1408
01:51:19,815 --> 01:51:24,484
Sasi, look! It's me!

1409
01:51:25,926 --> 01:51:29,235
Aunt! How did you come here?

1410
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:31,961
I didn't come.
It's who came to our place.

1411
01:51:32,735 --> 01:51:33,263
Me?

1412
01:51:37,403 --> 01:51:38,134
Where are we?

1413
01:51:38,824 --> 01:51:41,689
Don't get scared, I'll tell you.
Get up dear.

1414
01:51:44,788 --> 01:51:47,256
Did you hear me?
Ruin the wedding.

1415
01:51:48,102 --> 01:51:49,363
-Chinamaya
-My leader!

1416
01:51:49,587 --> 01:51:51,375
Use your magical powers and illusion

1417
01:51:51,689 --> 01:51:54,127
And build a guest city
for Kauravas in Dwaraka.

1418
01:51:54,227 --> 01:51:54,989
Yes

1419
01:51:55,231 --> 01:51:57,602
Spellbound them with your magic.

1420
01:51:57,707 --> 01:51:58,421
Hail leader!

1421
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:00,575
-Hey Rambu
-My lord

1422
01:52:00,599 --> 01:52:01,536
-Hey Rambu
-My lord

1423
01:52:01,674 --> 01:52:04,415
Use your intelligence and
teach Kauravas a fitting lesson.

1424
01:52:05,433 --> 01:52:07,870
-Hosting a wedding is a tough task.
-But ruining it is a piece of cake.

1425
01:52:07,946 --> 01:52:13,787
[cheering]
Stop!

1426
01:52:14,782 --> 01:52:15,188
Get going!

1427
01:52:23,202 --> 01:52:24,126
Where's my brother?

1428
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:26,562
Brother!

1429
01:52:53,155 --> 01:52:58,061
Beau got beaten up!

1430
01:52:58,262 --> 01:52:58,838
Who is it?

1431
01:53:00,409 --> 01:53:04,161
Sasi, how did you come here?
-Stay away.

1432
01:53:04,396 --> 01:53:06,859
Calling me now by leaving me in solitude.

1433
01:53:07,475 --> 01:53:08,578
-What is this, Sasi?
-Stay away.

1434
01:53:09,403 --> 01:53:10,142
Why are you so angry?

1435
01:53:10,758 --> 01:53:14,253
Don't you know I didn't take
chances respecting elders' words.

1436
01:53:14,472 --> 01:53:17,024
Fair enough! You must get a
good name for respecting elders,

1437
01:53:17,551 --> 01:53:19,497
and I must get bad name
for going against elders.

1438
01:53:19,706 --> 01:53:22,522
Enough, good bye to you and your love.

1439
01:53:22,672 --> 01:53:23,715
Now, it's brotherly love between us.

1440
01:53:23,988 --> 01:53:25,681
Sasi! What are you saying?

1441
01:53:25,996 --> 01:53:27,459
That's it.

1442
01:53:28,563 --> 01:53:30,628
I can't bear your sorrows or
pangs of separation any more.

1443
01:53:31,235 --> 01:53:33,983
I promised to marry Lakshmana
Kumara. And I'll stick to my word.

1444
01:53:35,044 --> 01:53:36,287
Is it my Sasi who is saying this?

1445
01:53:36,778 --> 01:53:40,095
No, I'm a brand new Sasi.
Totally changed.

1446
01:53:40,543 --> 01:53:43,183
I'll marry Lakshmana Kumara,
ride on elephant,

1447
01:53:43,261 --> 01:53:46,108
-and go to palace in a procession.
-Sasi, what's this nasty?

1448
01:53:46,414 --> 01:53:49,435
-Are you possessed by ghost?
-Not ghost but demon.

1449
01:53:50,036 --> 01:53:54,395
But now, it's brotherly love between us.
Come brother. Come.

1450
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,845
I'm really very lucky, dear.

1451
01:53:58,944 --> 01:54:02,161
Krishna, Rukmini,
Balarama, Revathi,

1452
01:54:02,222 --> 01:54:03,196
everyone will come to my home for you.

1453
01:54:03,932 --> 01:54:06,399
Aunt... where is my brother-in-law?

1454
01:54:06,455 --> 01:54:09,277
I'm coming, sister-in-law.
Come, brother.

1455
01:54:14,876 --> 01:54:15,812
Did you see, brother?

1456
01:54:16,435 --> 01:54:18,308
Leave me to Lakshmana Kumara,

1457
01:54:18,501 --> 01:54:19,433
and you take your Sasi.

1458
01:54:20,237 --> 01:54:22,050
[chuckles]

1459
01:54:22,133 --> 01:54:24,612
Is this Lord Krishna's
instruction too, son?

1460
01:54:25,149 --> 01:54:26,145
Yes, mother.

1461
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:31,415
Only God knows how that groom
is going to bear me as a bride.

1462
01:54:33,777 --> 01:54:35,912
How about brother-in-law's voice, aunt?

1463
01:54:37,495 --> 01:54:41,876
Don't worry about me, sister-in-law,
take good care of him.

1464
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:46,222
Auspicious time is nearing,
I'm leaving now.

1465
01:54:46,788 --> 01:54:47,886
Hail mother!

1466
01:54:51,865 --> 01:54:53,798
Hail Lord Krishna!

1467
01:55:17,197 --> 01:55:18,626
Place it here. Quick.

1468
01:55:24,633 --> 01:55:25,791
What's this, master?

1469
01:55:26,432 --> 01:55:27,783
This is the plan of the Guest city.

1470
01:55:28,072 --> 01:55:31,524
Look...
These are harems.

1471
01:55:33,942 --> 01:55:35,954
These are the magical houses.

1472
01:55:36,704 --> 01:55:38,493
What are these lines, master?

1473
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:39,422
Build them.

1474
01:55:39,646 --> 01:55:43,740
We shall check the errors in
the plan and then execute it.

1475
01:55:43,829 --> 01:55:45,280
Alright. Be on it.

1476
01:55:45,418 --> 01:55:48,118
But, where is the door to enter inside?

1477
01:55:49,327 --> 01:55:51,401
Here, this is the main entrance.

1478
01:55:51,828 --> 01:55:53,477
-Main entrance.
-Yes.

1479
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:55,497
It shouldn't be in that
direction. Place it there.

1480
01:55:55,589 --> 01:55:58,766
No, that's north. It doesn't come
under the construction standards.

1481
01:55:58,843 --> 01:56:01,116
Your construction standards is for
those who can't think on their own.

1482
01:56:01,309 --> 01:56:01,975
But not for us.

1483
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:05,206
Anti friends enter from that direction,
so the entrance should be placed there.

1484
01:56:05,466 --> 01:56:06,782
Alright. As you say.

1485
01:56:06,859 --> 01:56:07,364
Get up.

1486
01:56:09,116 --> 01:56:09,721
Close your eyes.

01:56:38,853 --> 01:56:39,435
Hey Jambu

[cheering]

1491
01:56:47,856 --> 01:56:49,753
Astonishing!

1492
01:56:49,909 --> 01:56:51,292
Don't praise.

1493
01:56:51,674 --> 01:56:54,731
Well master, it's all empty.

1494
01:56:54,928 --> 01:56:58,738
Where are the things to
take task our anti friends?

1495
01:56:59,043 --> 01:57:01,070
Things? Look yonder!

[reciting spell]

1497
01:57:10,686 --> 01:57:12,422
They are serpent jewels.

1498
01:57:14,846 --> 01:57:16,468
-These are...
-Am... Aha....

1499
01:57:16,476 --> 01:57:17,316
Shh!

Look at this!

Madam Sasirekha!

Madam bride!

1511
01:59:26,279 --> 01:59:28,878
It's morning, please wake up.

1512
01:59:30,095 --> 01:59:30,918
Madam bride.

1513
01:59:31,352 --> 01:59:37,279
[groaning]

1514
01:59:46,504 --> 01:59:50,369
Madam... Sasirekha...
why are you staring at me?

1515
01:59:50,851 --> 01:59:52,350
I'm your favourite maid.

1516
01:59:53,021 --> 01:59:56,529
Yes... you're my favourite maid.
What happened?

1517
01:59:56,695 --> 02:00:00,006
Did you have any bad dream?
You gave a loud cry!

1518
02:00:00,503 --> 02:00:03,801
Yes, a bad dream,
dreamt of becoming a devil.

1519
02:00:04,051 --> 02:00:05,558
It seems my voice too had changed.

1520
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:07,867
-Have I got back my original voice?
-Yes, madam.

1521
02:00:08,190 --> 02:00:11,504
Please be gentle, other maids are scared.

1522
02:00:11,963 --> 02:00:13,656
Oh maids!

1523
02:00:16,167 --> 02:00:17,160
Why are you afraid of me?

1524
02:00:19,104 --> 02:00:19,919
Oh!

1525
02:00:21,685 --> 02:00:23,309
What's this?
Who put a broken pedestal here?

1526
02:00:23,411 --> 02:00:25,123
Poor girls! Don't shout at them.

1527
02:00:25,416 --> 02:00:29,205
I could've been little
subtle. Maids, come.

1528
02:00:30,619 --> 02:00:34,484
Madam, you appear very strange today.

1529
02:00:35,686 --> 02:00:39,616
Do you think I'm still that old Sasirekha?

1530
02:00:39,957 --> 02:00:44,196
No. I'm the fiance of Lakshmana Kumara.

1531
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:48,921
It means my husband is the
future king and I'm the future queen.

1532
02:00:49,079 --> 02:00:52,796
Shh! You shouldn't say like that madam.
Look, your mother Revathi is coming.

1533
02:00:53,237 --> 02:00:56,391
Mother? Oh God! Mother!

1534
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:01,627
Hail mother, I bow to you.

1535
02:01:01,973 --> 02:01:05,765
Is this true?
Did you see her Rukmini?

1536
02:01:06,173 --> 02:01:09,102
Mother Rukmini! I bow to you.

1537
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:15,808
-Hail Krishna!
-Bless you!

1538
02:01:16,938 --> 02:01:18,982
Have we become strangers already, Sasi?

1539
02:01:19,247 --> 02:01:20,662
You're showing so much respect.

1540
02:01:21,134 --> 02:01:22,902
I'm just following your advice.

1541
02:01:23,095 --> 02:01:26,421
Let it be anyone's advice dear,
you've become obedient.

1542
02:01:26,763 --> 02:01:27,728
That's enough for me.

1543
02:01:28,119 --> 02:01:30,893
Krishna, I'm really very happy.

1544
02:01:31,508 --> 02:01:34,128
If you conduct this
marriage with a great fanfare...

1545
02:01:34,321 --> 02:01:36,616
As you say sister-in-law.
You will see it.

Did you see the lavishness
of the Yadavas, uncle?

02:06:12,370 --> 02:06:14,219
This fortune, these riches,

1597
02:06:14,492 --> 02:06:15,248
this exhibition,

1598
02:06:15,794 --> 02:06:18,286
I think they did this to upstage us.

1599
02:06:19,052 --> 02:06:20,777
Any doubt in it, Duryodhana?

1600
02:06:21,242 --> 02:06:24,780
When Krishna promised
to conduct the marriage,

1601
02:06:25,053 --> 02:06:26,805
I expected this grand affair.

1602
02:06:27,262 --> 02:06:29,993
Whatever they may do,
it's nothing compared to your riches.

1603
02:06:30,090 --> 02:06:31,313
Well said, uncle.

1604
02:06:33,010 --> 02:06:34,494
We are blessed along with you, Lords.

1605
02:06:34,621 --> 02:06:38,241
We're received the same grand
reception and hospitality as that of you!

grandeur have wasted their lives."

"This is what you call prosperity."

1610
02:06:50,855 --> 02:06:56,244
"Your kinsman's riches,
run out of words to praise it!"

1611
02:06:56,406 --> 02:06:56,969
Shh!

1612
02:06:57,629 --> 02:06:59,240
What's this nuisance, uncle?

1613
02:07:05,934 --> 02:07:09,608
You both are scholars but
have no common sense.

1614
02:07:09,681 --> 02:07:10,711
-As you say.

1615
02:07:10,881 --> 02:07:14,391
How dare you praise
others before your lord?

1616
02:07:14,967 --> 02:07:17,349
Our mistake.
Please forgive us, lord.

1617
02:07:17,541 --> 02:07:19,212
We got emotional and blurted out truth...

1618
02:07:19,571 --> 02:07:23,005
Though it's true, never praise others.

1619
02:07:23,173 --> 02:07:25,337
We are grooms' side.
Behave highhandedly!

1620
02:07:25,564 --> 02:07:28,504
Finding faults in everything,
irritate them.

1621
02:07:29,229 --> 02:07:31,191
-Got you lord.
-What did you get?

1622
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:34,716
Watch out now!
We'll torture your kinsmen.

What if she feels shy to meet him?

She can't be a brave
wife if she feels shy,

I want to talk to her.

in our reception, guests?

Shortcoming at peaks!
Come with us, we'll show you.

1685

Such a cheap blankets for us?
-What?

1686
02:11:44,491 --> 02:11:47,690
When we gave this to maid servants
of our village, they've discarded them.

1687
02:11:48,091 --> 02:11:50,650
Respected guests,
we're aren't aware of your status.

1688
02:11:50,825 --> 02:11:52,754
Just order us what you
want, we'll arrange it.

-I want silk blanket.
-Okay.

1690
02:11:55,834 --> 02:11:59,120
-I want silk carpet.
-Oh! Okay.

1691
02:11:59,316 --> 02:12:01,196
Just don't say okay.

1692
02:12:01,486 --> 02:12:05,068
-Silk carpet... got it?
-Okay.

1693
02:12:08,758 --> 02:12:11,116
Hello wedding hosts,
what are you doing here?

1694
02:12:11,309 --> 02:12:14,898
We want fans there and
young maidens to blow it.

1695
02:12:15,097 --> 02:12:17,806
-What a wish!
-What a nasty wish!

1696
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:20,222
-What nonsense?
-Get out!

1697
02:12:20,242 --> 02:12:22,886
-Do you know who I am?
-Do you know who we are?

1698
02:12:22,977 --> 02:12:23,467
Shh!

1699
02:12:24,090 --> 02:12:26,115
You're getting angry unable
to understand the language.

1700
02:12:26,378 --> 02:12:29,000
What he said means great!

1701
02:12:29,288 --> 02:12:30,821
You're scholars,
don't you know it?

1702
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:34,431
We were just getting it,
you said it.

1703
02:12:35,322 --> 02:12:37,182
I'll tell the meaning of other word.

1704
02:12:37,317 --> 02:12:39,620
The other word means respect.
Am I right?

1705
02:12:39,745 --> 02:12:41,847
Yes...
[chuckles]

1706
02:12:42,296 --> 02:12:44,498
Is it that?
-Yes, it is that.

1707
02:12:44,757 --> 02:12:45,676
Then come here.

1708
02:12:53,896 --> 02:12:56,757
Such a cheap cot for a
respected man like me?

1709
02:12:57,719 --> 02:12:58,700
Foam bed.. Foam bed.

1710
02:13:00,731 --> 02:13:04,491
-I want foam bed.
-Foam bed? We'll get it.

02:13:52,316 --> 02:13:56,424
Oh! Why have you displayed the
things that are eye-catching?

1726
02:13:56,785 --> 02:13:58,783
-They're for you, take a look.
-Really?

1727
02:14:03,623 --> 02:14:06,645
Oh my goodness!
They are more delicate than me.

1728
02:14:06,962 --> 02:14:11,217
A touch broke the jewel,
I've lots of much stronger jewels.

1729
02:14:11,684 --> 02:14:15,674
Yes, dear.
You're jovial without being ashamed.

1730
02:14:16,347 --> 02:14:17,411
I'm happy.

1731
02:14:18,169 --> 02:14:21,769
Your groom wants to meet you.
Let's meet him, come.

1732
02:14:22,300 --> 02:14:24,486
Then I too have a condition.

1733
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:27,979
If you want me to meet groom,
you must show your skill.

1734
02:14:28,242 --> 02:14:34,061
Good granddaughter,
but I've many skills.

1735
02:14:34,286 --> 02:14:37,273
-Which one shall I show you?
-Why anything else?

1736
02:14:37,604 --> 02:14:41,299
I want to see you play dice.

1737
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:43,646
Play, else I'll not meet the groom.

1738
02:14:44,549 --> 02:14:48,302
Grand daughters are like this,
playing fun with grandpas.

1739
02:14:48,779 --> 02:14:52,608
Okay, I'll play only once.
Tell me your number.

1740
02:14:54,458 --> 02:14:54,971
Two!

1741
02:14:57,732 --> 02:14:58,972

1745
02:15:08,498 --> 02:15:09,695
Ah! Two!

Two... Yes, it's two.

1747
02:15:12,292 --> 02:15:14,542
If one becomes two,
then six will become three.

1748
02:15:14,651 --> 02:15:16,392
We both have won.

1749
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:19,174
Grandpa, you play dice very well.

1750
02:15:20,194 --> 02:15:24,824
Isn't that groom near the lake?
I'll meet him. Come Myna.

1751
02:15:33,388 --> 02:15:34,359
Why is she behaving like this?

1752
02:15:34,792 --> 02:15:40,387
Is Sasirekha an illusionist or
was it a flash that blinded my eye?

1753
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:44,675
Looking at her behaviour and
attitude, my son may...

1754
02:15:44,835 --> 02:15:48,532
No need to fear.
Our Lakshmana is her perfect match.

02:27:12,704 --> 02:27:14,645
I fell in love with her, desired her,

1876
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:15,972
and sang a song too.

1877
02:27:17,653 --> 02:27:20,743
-What about the bride?
-Bride? Silly bride!

1878
02:27:20,984 --> 02:27:22,911
She asked me stay away
saying elders are there.

1879
02:27:23,090 --> 02:27:24,118
Told me to wait till tomorrow.

1880
02:27:24,379 --> 02:27:26,904
How can I wait till tomorrow, Sarathy?

1881
02:27:27,162 --> 02:27:30,633
You're strong and great,
Abhimanyu would be dead by now.

1882
02:27:30,708 --> 02:27:32,692
-Well said, Sarathy!
-Why Lord?

1883
02:27:32,886 --> 02:27:35,842
Nothing.
They get stuck on joining.

1884
02:27:38,105 --> 02:27:41,958
They ate the feast themselves
and kept empty vessels for us.

1885
02:27:42,083 --> 02:27:42,613
Did you see?

1886
02:27:46,498 --> 02:27:51,489
-Sharma
-Shastri

1887
02:27:51,547 --> 02:27:53,775
-Oh! Hard vadas!
-Hard vadas!

1888
02:27:53,851 --> 02:27:55,013
-Stuffed sweets.
-Stuffed sweets.

1889
02:27:56,772 --> 02:27:57,774
Come here.

1890
02:28:02,373 --> 02:28:06,222
I told you to play with kinsmen,
are you playing with me?

1891
02:28:06,232 --> 02:28:08,404
-Are you possessed by ghost?
-No...

1892
02:28:08,723 --> 02:28:11,927
What's that? I've been watching
you since coming here,

1893
02:28:12,066 --> 02:28:14,144
you seem to losing your senses,

1894
02:28:14,345 --> 02:28:18,341
if you don't start behaving sensibly,
I'll get you a good head massage.

1895
02:28:18,691 --> 02:28:19,641
Be careful!

1896
02:28:19,957 --> 02:28:21,168
Okay okay!

1897
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:25,003
-Sarma.
-Yeah

1898
02:28:25,452 --> 02:28:27,132
-What is this?
-Hand.

1899
02:28:27,577 --> 02:28:28,828
-How many are these?
-Three!

1900
02:28:29,117 --> 02:28:29,959
Pinch me.

1901
02:28:32,147 --> 02:28:33,163
Then...

1902
02:28:36,779 --> 02:28:38,553
-Want carpet.
-Shh!

1903
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:40,582
Abracadabra!

1904
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:42,252
[laughing]
-Shh!

1905
02:28:42,965 --> 02:28:45,108
Abracadabra!
[laughing]

1906
02:28:47,319 --> 02:28:48,423
Abracadabra!

1907
02:28:48,624 --> 02:28:50,657
[laughing]
-Shh!

1908
02:28:51,401 --> 02:28:52,490
Foam bed!

1909
02:29:00,313 --> 02:29:02,272
We want foam bed.

1910
02:29:02,777 --> 02:29:03,581
Shh!

1911
02:29:03,954 --> 02:29:07,317
Abracadabra!
[laughing]

1912
02:29:07,518 --> 02:29:09,148
Shh!
[door opened]

1913
02:29:09,804 --> 02:29:11,704
Enemies are coming.

1914
02:29:16,196 --> 02:29:17,920
-Oh god!
-Aah!

1915
02:29:18,760 --> 02:29:24,746
Was the feast thing a magic
or an illusion or a spell?

1916
02:29:25,406 --> 02:29:28,483
-What do you say?
-Nothing, pure hallucination.

1917
02:29:29,201 --> 02:29:30,781
-You think like that?
-Yes.

1918
02:29:36,704 --> 02:29:37,785
Is it carpet?

1919
02:29:38,578 --> 02:29:39,940
They removed smaller one
and laid a bigger one.

1920
02:29:40,517 --> 02:29:43,735
They thought it's a bigger carpet.

1921
02:29:44,216 --> 02:29:47,418
Their ancestors must come down for it.
[laughing]

1922
02:29:48,277 --> 02:29:49,543
-Betel leaves!
-Let's have them!

1923
02:29:54,863 --> 02:29:56,420
[chuckles]

1924
02:30:04,588 --> 02:30:06,788
[chuckling]

1925
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:10,545
Sarma...

1926
02:30:11,679 --> 02:30:12,886
What we saw, vanished away.

1927
02:30:13,244 --> 02:30:14,588
What vanished, appeared again.

1928
02:30:20,625 --> 02:30:23,397
-Do you think this is also hallucination?
-Yes, hallucination only.

1929
02:30:24,190 --> 02:30:25,278
-Whoa?
-Oh!

1930
02:30:26,078 --> 02:30:28,018
-Yeah [chuckles]
-Eh?

1931
02:30:31,166 --> 02:30:31,898
Nah!

1932
02:30:34,405 --> 02:30:39,422
-Reason for this hallucinations?
-Nothing much, a form of madness.

1933
02:30:41,421 --> 02:30:42,896
What's this?

1934
02:30:43,166 --> 02:30:45,381
-Carpet is new one.
-Yes yes!

1935
02:30:45,579 --> 02:30:46,988
-So it's rollong up.
-Yeah.

1936
02:30:47,226 --> 02:30:48,328
-Let's spread it.
[groans]

1937

[groans]

1938
02:30:53,141 --> 02:30:54,985
Stay!

1939
02:30:59,442 --> 02:31:00,569
-Oh god!
-No!

1940
02:31:02,148 --> 02:31:03,228
-Oh no!
-No!

1941
02:31:05,276 --> 02:31:06,880
-Sarma!
[groans]

1942
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:09,458
Is this hallucination too?

1943
02:31:09,817 --> 02:31:11,764
This is delusion.

1944
02:31:11,832 --> 02:31:17,842
-Oh god! We are dead Sarma!
-Oh my god!

1945
02:31:18,458 --> 02:31:21,915
-Sarma! What's this now?
-This is death illusion.

1946
02:31:22,344 --> 02:31:25,555
Sarma! We don't need any
illusion or carpets, let's go.

1947
02:31:26,706 --> 02:31:27,212
[groans]

1948
02:31:33,863 --> 02:31:34,563
Sarma!

1949
02:31:34,764 --> 02:31:36,302
-Oh!
-Ah!

1950
02:31:37,963 --> 02:31:38,812
[howling]

1951
02:31:39,768 --> 02:31:41,438
-Sarma!
-Oh god!

1952
02:31:47,012 --> 02:31:49,735
Foam bed!
- Foam bed!

1953
02:31:51,088 --> 02:31:53,704
Carpet trouble is over
but foam bed is great.

1954
02:31:53,905 --> 02:31:55,015
It's awesome!

1955
02:31:55,423 --> 02:31:56,618
-Oh man!
-Aah!

1956
02:31:57,962 --> 02:32:03,976
-Ouch!
-Ouch!

1957
02:32:05,869 --> 02:32:06,740
[groans]

1958
02:32:07,571 --> 02:32:08,454
Oh no!

1959
02:32:15,354 --> 02:32:17,546
-Oh god!
-Aah!

1960
02:32:18,568 --> 02:32:23,789

02:32:37,228 --> 02:32:38,586
-Oh!
-Whoa!

1963
02:32:49,945 --> 02:32:52,882
[knocks]
Sarma! Sastry! The door.

1964
02:32:54,109 --> 02:32:56,242
Hey guys! Open the door.

1965
02:32:56,708 --> 02:32:57,776
[knocks]
Oh!

1966
02:32:59,735 --> 02:33:00,827
Open the door!

1967
02:33:01,459 --> 02:33:02,608
Open it... open it.

1968
02:33:04,361 --> 02:33:05,778
I know how to... wait!

1969
02:33:08,725 --> 02:33:12,739
-Oh Shiva!
-Oh Shiva!

1970
02:33:14,528 --> 02:33:17,436
Sarathy? Is it you who fell?

1971
02:33:18,021 --> 02:33:21,874
Fell? I was doing somersaults.
- Is it? Get up.

1972
02:33:22,019 --> 02:33:24,775
Why are you sitting in a corner
leaving the carpet and foam bed?

1973
02:33:25,069 --> 02:33:27,924
-Oh! That's for men like you.
-Please, go ahead.

1974
02:33:28,198 --> 02:33:29,479
Okay.

1975
02:33:31,097 --> 02:33:36,123
-Oh Shiva!
-Oh Shiva!

1976
02:33:39,684 --> 02:33:42,392
What's this?
Is it a place to keep your slippers?

1977
02:33:42,660 --> 02:33:45,328
-Do you've any sense?
-No, we didn't keep it there.

1978
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:47,426
If not, did they come here on their own?

1979
02:33:49,746 --> 02:33:51,404
Maybe, we didn't see.

1980
02:33:58,075 --> 02:34:00,102
Wow! Foam bed!

1981
02:34:00,864 --> 02:34:03,656
What a luxury!

1982
02:34:05,585 --> 02:34:09,145
Amazing! Heavenly!

1983
02:34:09,318 --> 02:34:10,690
What a great comfort!

1984
02:34:11,778 --> 02:34:13,402
Did you see the foam bed?

1985
02:34:15,078 --> 02:34:16,436
Heaven... it's heaven.

1986
02:34:39,664 --> 02:34:40,951
Oh God!

1987
02:34:42,253 --> 02:34:43,623
Just a while ago,
you laughed loud at me.

1988
02:34:43,811 --> 02:34:46,014
Now, it's nothing. Very good.

1989
02:34:50,256 --> 02:34:56,192
Oh no! Ouch! Oh God!

1990
02:35:07,070 --> 02:35:08,412
Oh God!

1991
02:35:11,378 --> 02:35:15,777
-May you be blessed with peace!
-May you be blessed with peace!

1992
02:35:23,327 --> 02:35:24,741
What brings you at this hour?

1993
02:35:26,443 --> 02:35:31,396
After meeting the bride, I'm confused.

1994
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:34,236
I feel like cancelling this marriage.

1995
02:35:34,533 --> 02:35:37,996
Did you see? That's Krishna's magic.

1996
02:35:38,361 --> 02:35:39,795
He made Sasi to act like this

1997
02:35:40,037 --> 02:35:45,052
so that we'll cancel
this wedding ourselves.

1998
02:35:45,958 --> 02:35:47,906
Can we fall into his trap?

1999
02:35:48,734 --> 02:35:52,435
Let the marriage be over,
everything would come in line.

2000
02:35:54,407 --> 02:35:55,262
Understood, mother?

2001
02:35:55,578 --> 02:35:57,844
At the same time when I
tie the knot over there,

2002
02:35:58,022 --> 02:36:00,849
Abhimanyu should do the same
here and it is Lord Krishna's order.

2003
02:36:01,335 --> 02:36:02,710
In my brother's absence?

2004
02:36:02,754 --> 02:36:06,322
No need to doubt it,
he'll be here as well as there.

2005
02:36:06,422 --> 02:36:07,266
Omnipresent.

2006
02:36:08,150 --> 02:36:10,862
I'll go now and ruin that wedding,

2007
02:36:11,055 --> 02:36:14,751
I'll be here with Balarama and others
in time to bless the new couple.

2008
02:36:14,826 --> 02:36:16,840
I'll purify our ashram, mother.

2009
02:36:16,871 --> 02:36:19,237
Do it son, I'll appreciate you.

2010
02:36:19,737 --> 02:36:21,521

For me...
For me...

2032
02:38:38,210 --> 02:38:39,774
What's your objection?
Remove the screen.

2033
02:38:40,441 --> 02:38:42,648
You mustn't say like
that, they may feel bad.

2034
02:38:42,705 --> 02:38:44,467
I don't care, I'm the groom.

2035
02:38:44,713 --> 02:38:46,152
I've every right to see the bride.

2036
02:38:46,245 --> 02:38:47,985
Grandpa, father-in-law,
get the screen removed.

2037
02:38:52,218 --> 02:38:53,346
What's your problem, son?

2038
02:38:53,412 --> 02:38:55,030
Why a screen hurdle between
me and the bride?

2039
02:38:55,322 --> 02:38:55,925
Get it removed.

2040
02:38:56,480 --> 02:38:57,901
What is he saying?

2041
02:38:58,161 --> 02:39:01,870
Nothing, it's not our tradition
to hold the screen for so long.

2042
02:39:02,034 --> 02:39:02,458
That's it.

2043
02:39:02,836 --> 02:39:06,524
But I think following our
traditions in our place is justified.

2044
02:39:06,763 --> 02:39:10,636
Which ever place it may be,
let it be done as they wish.

2045
02:39:10,817 --> 02:39:13,211
That's what I'm saying. Remove the screen.

2046
02:39:16,410 --> 02:39:18,855
Wonderful, Karna!
Our boy has established our supremacy.

2047
02:39:19,313 --> 02:39:22,689
I've told you long ago that
Lakshmana has more pride than father.

2048
02:39:23,319 --> 02:39:27,268
Karna, I feel pity on
seeing Krishna's predicament.

2049
02:39:27,712 --> 02:39:30,601
It's not yet over, the worse has to come.

2050
02:39:32,705 --> 02:39:34,954
Carry on the function
according to our traditions.

2051
02:39:35,267 --> 02:39:36,529
As you say, okay.

2052
02:39:36,852 --> 02:39:39,263
First the bride and groom
must stamp each other's feet,

2053
02:39:39,339 --> 02:39:40,983
after that pressing hand.

2054
02:39:41,129 --> 02:39:43,130
Shastri, what's that nonsense?

2055
02:39:43,213 --> 02:39:49,092
My lord, you must stamp on the toe of
the bride's left leg with your right leg.

2056
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:50,512
Well, I'm ready for it.

2057
02:39:52,011 --> 02:39:56,303
You mustn't feel so shy.
You must also do it to him.

2058
02:39:56,543 --> 02:39:59,086
What if he gets angry?

2059
02:40:00,253 --> 02:40:02,363
Why would I get angry? I'm ready for it.

2060
02:40:03,811 --> 02:40:09,780
[chanting]

2061
02:40:23,042 --> 02:40:26,870
-Now, the bride must press your toe.
-No objection.

2062
02:40:32,489 --> 02:40:38,168
Ouch! Oh my God!

2063
02:40:38,439 --> 02:40:39,692
You killed me... killed me...

2064
02:40:40,014 --> 02:40:41,924
What about you when you stamped my toe?

2065
02:40:42,777 --> 02:40:45,664
Shastri and Sharma, I have to press
the hand, right? Tell her to do it.

2066
02:40:46,114 --> 02:40:49,039
-You know to vedic science too, right?
-Yes, I do.

2067
02:41:00,844 --> 02:41:04,097
-Now, bride must press your hand.
-No need.

2068
02:41:04,148 --> 02:41:06,466
No, you mustn't say no.
Give your hand to her.

2069
02:41:10,709 --> 02:41:16,685
[bones cracking]
Ouch! Oh no!

2070
02:41:19,210 --> 02:41:22,697
-My hand!
-What do you want?

2071
02:41:23,631 --> 02:41:24,878
-I want turmeric-rice to bless.
-Turmeric rice to bless?

2072
02:41:24,886 --> 02:41:26,106
It's last in the program.

2073
02:41:27,576 --> 02:41:29,378
What's all this, Krishna?

2074
02:41:29,487 --> 02:41:31,391
Modern time youth are like that, brother.

2075
02:41:32,290 --> 02:41:36,055
Son-in-law, my daughter is little scared,

2076
02:41:36,328 --> 02:41:38,821
do it little slowly.

2077
02:41:39,568 --> 02:41:40,805
If scared, she can't be a brave wife.

2078
02:41:41,030 --> 02:41:42,555
Shastri and Sharma, continue.

2079
02:41:43,385 --> 02:41:46,558
Wow uncle! He gave a
good repartee to Krishna.

2080
02:41:49,174 --> 02:41:52,208
Keep this jaggery and cumin
seeds on the bride's head. [chanting]

2081
02:41:52,253 --> 02:41:52,755
I know.

2082
02:42:01,065 --> 02:42:02,698
[gibbers]

2083
02:42:03,016 --> 02:42:06,969
Monkey... Monkey
Father, monkey...

2084
02:42:07,078 --> 02:42:10,116
-What's this, Lakshmana?
-Monkey!

2085
02:42:10,345 --> 02:42:12,269
-What is it?
-Monkey, grandpa.

2086
02:42:12,795 --> 02:42:13,362
Come with me.

2087
02:42:22,363 --> 02:42:25,580
Why are you calling
a beautiful girl as monkey?

2088
02:42:26,279 --> 02:42:27,713
Is it time to romance?

2089
02:42:28,668 --> 02:42:29,125
Go ahead.

2090
02:42:35,615 --> 02:42:36,720
Keep it on her head.
[chanting]

2091
02:42:52,435 --> 02:42:57,917

2092
02:43:06,438 --> 02:43:06,904
[sneezes]

2093
02:43:07,243 --> 02:43:09,118
Can't you hold it back?

2094
02:43:09,682 --> 02:43:11,401
Go ahead, finish it.
[sneezes]

2095
02:43:15,108 --> 02:43:15,614
[sneezes]

2096
02:43:17,696 --> 02:43:21,871
I think it is due to change of water.
These sneezes doesn't mean anything.

2097
02:43:22,450 --> 02:43:23,864
Carry on.

2098
02:43:24,084 --> 02:43:27,303
-Pity! Change of water.
-Pity!

2099
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:42,196
[wedding percussions]

2100
02:43:43,193 --> 02:43:44,470
[roars]

2101
02:43:44,691 --> 02:43:49,851
Oh my God! Tiger! Tiger!
Father, tiger...

2102
02:43:50,044 --> 02:43:53,584
-What's this Lakshmana?
-Tiger...

2103
02:43:53,718 --> 02:43:56,048
-It's not tiger, he's Krishna.
-Yes, son-in-law.

2104
02:43:58,293 --> 02:44:00,698
Mother! What's this humiliation?

2105
02:44:01,022 --> 02:44:03,316
I don't know, dear.
I don't know what sin I've committed?

2106
02:44:03,770 --> 02:44:06,167
Didn't you see the groom earlier, dear?

2107
02:44:07,096 --> 02:44:10,631
Why didn't you tell me, Duryodhana?
Is your son having any mental issues?

2108
02:44:12,635 --> 02:44:15,486
Forgive me, our prince is a brave warrior.

2109
02:44:15,842 --> 02:44:18,394
I'm surprised to see him so scared.

2110
02:44:18,953 --> 02:44:21,885
I think it is the work of
black magic of our enemies.

2111
02:44:22,141 --> 02:44:23,532
You know its solution, right?

2112
02:44:23,938 --> 02:44:25,842
Smear sacred ash and tie an amulet.

2113
02:44:26,844 --> 02:44:27,318
Come here.

2114
02:44:29,957 --> 02:44:35,179
-This is holy armour!
-This will protect you.

2115
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:40,541
-This is holy armour!
-This will protect you.

2116
02:44:43,795 --> 02:44:45,690
No matter what, I don't want to marry her.

2117
02:44:45,898 --> 02:44:46,883
Tiger... Tiger...

2118
02:44:47,281 --> 02:44:49,535
If you refuse,
I'll get her married to Abhimanyu.

2119
02:44:49,578 --> 02:44:52,490
-No away, I want her.
-Then, come.

2120
02:44:57,231 --> 02:45:03,230
[chanting]

2121
02:45:19,338 --> 02:45:22,083
Awe!

2122
02:45:23,734 --> 02:45:24,750
De... Devil!

2123
02:45:27,136 --> 02:45:28,908
Lakshmana...
Uncle!

2124
02:45:31,069 --> 02:45:31,545
Son...

2125
02:45:37,299 --> 02:45:41,168
Oh! Prince has fainted.

2126
02:45:41,332 --> 02:45:42,731
[screams]
Laksmana...

2127
02:45:44,202 --> 02:45:46,165
Oh! Our prince has fainted.

2128
02:45:46,470 --> 02:45:48,477
-Immediate duty?
-Get him out of it.

2129
02:45:49,067 --> 02:45:49,942
No use.

2130
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:53,052
He'll not wake up till this
magical illusion is broken.

2131
02:45:53,981 --> 02:45:55,180
What's all this, uncle?

2132
02:45:55,761 --> 02:45:59,799
I suspected foul play when
Krishna supported this marriage.

2133
02:46:08,222 --> 02:46:09,246
Uncle... uncle...

2134
02:46:09,709 --> 02:46:12,316
Don't disturb him.
I must know the truth.

2135
02:46:12,780 --> 02:46:14,760
Sathyaki, get me the plough.

2136
02:46:15,254 --> 02:46:17,543
Calm down Balarama.

2137
02:46:18,464 --> 02:46:22,908
l swear on my dice and tell you the truth.

2138
02:46:23,365 --> 02:46:24,274
Listen.

2139
02:46:25,281 --> 02:46:28,671
We usurped kingdom of Pandavas by
cheating them in the game of dice.

2140
02:46:29,618 --> 02:46:32,595
They kept their promise
and went into exile.

2141
02:46:33,175 --> 02:46:36,031
You came rushing to punish us
on hearing this.

2142
02:46:36,185 --> 02:46:39,301
But you're a barlish innocent Yadava.

2143
02:46:40,696 --> 02:46:44,576
I know you'll easily fall for
praise and felicitation.

2144
02:46:44,867 --> 02:46:45,981
You did fall for it.

2145
02:46:46,362 --> 02:46:48,000
Though you're not equal to us,

2146
02:46:48,259 --> 02:46:50,675
do you know why we insisted on
accepting your daughter in marriage?

2147
02:46:51,226 --> 02:46:54,360
lf Pandavas attack us
after the exile period,

2148
02:46:54,625 --> 02:46:58,877
to keep you and your brother
away from joining their ranks.

2149
02:46:59,710 --> 02:47:05,213
Like as you sow so you reap,
we did got a good stick for it.

2150
02:47:06,873 --> 02:47:10,664
Krishna, these cheats shouldn't
be left with this punishment,

2151
02:47:11,184 --> 02:47:13,631
-Where's my plough?
- Brother!

2152
02:47:23,653 --> 02:47:25,441
Elder uncle, I bow to you.

2153
02:47:26,134 --> 02:47:30,147
You needn't have to strain yourself,
I'm here to finish them.

2154
02:47:31,292 --> 02:47:34,526
-Who are you?
- Me? Who am I?

2155
02:47:36,107 --> 02:47:38,641
When you were arrested by Angels,

2156
02:47:38,746 --> 02:47:42,326
Arjuna who came to release you free,

2157
02:47:42,527 --> 02:47:44,976
I'm his elder brother Bhima's son.

2158

Hey you Duryodhana, Dushyasana, Karna!

You evil minded people!

Weapons are protecting their
honour by not coming out.

2164
02:48:14,091 --> 02:48:15,051
I'll teach you a lesson.

2165
02:48:15,385 --> 02:48:17,874
Lambu and Jambu show
them your powers.

[people shrieking]

2167
02:48:35,073 --> 02:48:38,235
Duryodhana, you were arrogant
about your wealth.

2168
02:48:38,378 --> 02:48:39,990
Watch out, what happens
to your wealth.

2169
02:48:40,213 --> 02:48:41,169

02:49:46,471 --> 02:49:48,488
Cowards! I'll not kill refugees.

2176
02:49:48,621 --> 02:49:53,535

and dump them in Hastinapuram.

go against any of them."

Krishna, I never expected
Bhima's son will be so clever.

2194
02:51:34,524 --> 02:51:35,831
By the way, where's our daughter?

2195
02:51:36,462 --> 02:51:38,370

Sasi and Abhimanyu got married
in the same fixed time in my home,

2199

you must come, bless them
and be my guests.

2200

Why are you still here? Let's go.

2201

Come brother.

Sister-in-law Hidamba!
My daughter got married in your home.

Wherever the marriage may take
place, I don't have any objections.

Subadhra,
I'm handing my daughter happily to you.

2207
02:52:32,647 --> 02:52:36,289
Whatever it is, my son is
responsible for this to happen.

2208
02:52:36,490 --> 02:52:37,467
That gives me immense happiness.

2209
02:52:37,674 --> 02:52:40,773
No mother... no.
This was Lord Krishna's blessing.
