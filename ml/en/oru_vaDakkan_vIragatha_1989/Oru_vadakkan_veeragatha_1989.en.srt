00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:12,650
(English Subtitles)

2
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,457
A Northern legend of bravery

3
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:57,302
After fathers death this
cellar was never opened

4
00:01:57,362 --> 00:01:59,709
Yes, Mother told me that too

5
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:29,728
Uncle's battle dagger

6
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,831
Bamboo nail instead
of iron nail

7
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:55,205
The treachery is hidden
by gold coating

8
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:23,480
This is where the
lamp rod was kept. See !

9
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:37,747
Mom told me uncle recorded
it all on palm leaves, Aunt ?

10
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:06,102
"What can I say, Father"

11
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:12,008
"Of the Aringodan's play"

12
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:17,622
"He injured me no more
than a seed could"

13
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:24,756
"But cousin Chandu,
he did betray"

14
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:51,588
"Exhausted from the
weariness of battle"

15
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:58,608
"On Chandu's lap, I lay "

16
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:02,917
"Lazily I closed my eyes"

17
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,925
"That moment, Chandu transformed"

18
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:14,779
"He took the lamp rod"

19
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:21,949
"and pointed it at me"

20
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:49,739
"When I snapped to my senses"

21
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:55,725
"Chandu had taken
Aringodan's side"

22
00:05:56,217 --> 00:06:01,048
"Oh Father, it was Chandu's treachery !"

23
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:05,226
"Oh Archa, it was Chandu's treachery!"

24
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:19,889
"Father, it was Chandu's treachery.
Archa, it was Chandu's treachery"

25
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:53,090
Who's that?

26
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:57,558
Kunjunuli

27
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:10,814
Has Mattan come to
test me in my old age?

28
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:21,032
Aromini arrived from Atumanmel.
Your grandson and Kannapunni are sparring.

29
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,030
Yes, let them play

30
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:30,511
After my son Aromal died, I havent
heard the clang of a shortsword

31
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,286
Granddad, its me,
Aromal Unni.

32
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,693
Where's Archa

33
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,145
Mom's lighting the lamp
in outer compound

34
00:08:53,341 --> 00:09:00,186
What's the meaning of these
red marks and battle outfits?

35
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:16,539
Puturan and Atumanmel houses
have no shortage of wealth, but we lack in men.

36
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:25,722
You kids neednt win us fame/wealth
through battle. Ok?

37
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,415
But a debt remains
unpaid, Dad.

38
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:51,612
Your mom would say:Men of Puturan are
shortlived as sacrifical goats. How true.

39
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:56,416
Who are you in search of ?

40
00:09:56,751 --> 00:10:10,382
One who murdered his brother.
He still lives on in Kolathiri.

41
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:12,959
I'm disgusted to
speak his name.

42
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:22,802
At Karaparambu, Nambiars insulted
my son in front of hundreds

43
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:28,986
"Avenge Your uncle first. Then
speak of bravery" they said

44
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:34,271
He asked me about it,
so I told him the stories.

45
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:40,911
Why did no one tell me of this treason?

46
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:46,974
Is it true you insisted Dad beg his cousin
for help even when he mistrusted him?

47
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:55,544
Yes. Not just me.
Everyone insisted.

48
00:10:55,544 --> 00:11:04,083
I never thought he'd betray me.
Me, who fed him from childhood.

49
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:08,600
Hope you haven't
forgotten my oath

50
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:14,582
Sis-in-law, let Kanapan assist Aromal Unni.

51
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:17,614
Bless their quest, Father.

52
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:22,677
You want the Chekavars to be
wiped out through revenge ?

53
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:26,921
Aromal Unni's spirit
is unavenged, Dad.

54
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:32,176
The shortsword still trembles
in the cellar, Dad.

55
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:44,131
I know how Kannapunni fights.

56
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:47,516
And u?
Have you learnt the moves ?

57
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:56,500
I think so. He mastered advanced moves
from a Tulunad school.

58
00:11:57,228 --> 00:12:01,229
That's not enough
to win battle, kids.

59
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,677
Archa. They cannot beat Chandu.

60
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:16,777
He must acknowledge
Puturan house is still alive.

61
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:22,829
Is there a move u
havent taught anyone, Dad?

62
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:43,074
This move depends on
the enemy's anticipation.

63
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:48,075
When you begin the stance,
he must assume he is safe.

64
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:51,016
That's the only way to win.

65
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:57,018
When his head falls, tell him
I granted you this move.

66
00:12:57,018 --> 00:13:03,299
He never expects
someone to avenge Puturan house

67
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:07,060
Traitor Chandu

68
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:16,853
(Prays)

69
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:30,936
Respects to my Guru.

70
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:16,738
2 boys, waiting
at the gate.

71
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:30,762
They insisted on
'personally meeting chekava warrior'

72
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:34,493
Didnt you tell them
I stopped teaching long ago.

73
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:38,654
Have they come to learn, or teach me?

74
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:43,445
Dont know. They didnt tell
their names or intentions.

75
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:50,407
Young men now try to earn fame by
trying to beat Warrior Chandu.

76
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:58,409
I wont meet anyone.
Close the gate.

77
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:12,783
It's not right for Chekava warriors
to close doors on visitors.

78
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:26,586
We came to
become Your disciples

79
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:31,638
We dont teach here.
We teach at 17 other schools.

80
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:35,809
Where're you from?
-Karuthenar

81
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:42,271
Oh, I know the place. Which house ?
-Puturan house

82
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,426
Puturan. you are..?

83
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:08,187
Kanapunni, son of Aromal Chekavar

84
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:13,629
Would be easier if
u told Your mother's name.

85
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:18,730
Aromal often 'granted' sons to 'lucky women'
when he saw his chance.

86
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:24,422
My Dad has a single lawful wife:
my mother, Kunjunuli

87
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:29,783
Oh, Kunjunuli's son. So the son
from Mikavil would be Your senior.

88
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:34,784
His name?
-Unni kannan

89
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:36,835
And you ?

90
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:41,586
His nephew.
Atumanmel Kunjiramans son.

91
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:46,217
Son of Unni Archa eh.

92
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:57,970
Kids, you may return. I cant teach you more
than what Elder Kanapan has.

93
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,171
How is he now ?

94
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:04,162
We didnt come to catch up.
-Then?

95
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:06,823
To avenge Your murder
of my uncle.

96
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:11,823
Brace urself, chekava !

97
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:32,999
Oh. Did Your Mom give you last advice?

98
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:38,901
No tips on how to
face the murderous warrior ?

99
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:46,123
I recall she advised me
when I assisted Aromal once.

100
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:52,774
She told me it is
glory to die in battle.

101
00:17:53,025 --> 00:18:00,697
Only UnniArcha can say that.
Her tongue is anyday sharper than a sword.

102
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:09,079
Did she promise
a glorious funeral clothed in silk?

103
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:15,470
Dramatic inspirational
words are her forte.

104
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,962
Your Dad can show-off his
wife with the famous song:

105
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:25,083
"I'm a woman, but I tremble not.
Why do you men cower?"

106
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:30,084
I pity Your dad Kunjiraman.

107
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:36,656
Keep insults for after
the battle, Chandu uncle.

108
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:39,957
'Chandu uncle'

109
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:50,289
What do you know of the betrayals of 'traitor Chandu'
- Plenty

110
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:57,851
"Chandu, who replaced the iron nail with bamboo. Bribed the blacksmith to hide it in gold"

111
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,962
"Chandu, who lied that he forgot the replacement sword"

112
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:10,605
"Chandu, who stabbed the tired warrior with a lamp body, and then jumped to his escape."

113
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:30,360
What other betrayals do the bards sing of in Your land?
All you heard is true. And false.

114
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:42,363
Give them tender coconut and jaggery. Let the kids rest. And then leave.

115
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:47,324
I shall not fight.

116
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:53,206
'He who mastered all moves' is afraid ?

117
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:19,643
Our weapon is not a lamp. We wield a warriors weapon. Sword. And grand-dad's moves.

118
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:32,736
Does Chandu the warrior kill only sleeping warriors through cheating ?

119
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:38,588
He wont fight. Will you eat something?
-Stop distracting us.

120
00:20:40,818 --> 00:20:47,640
Are you still testing me, family deity ?

121
00:20:54,372 --> 00:21:00,683
They said they dont want food, that's not what they came for.

122
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:17,018
Yes. They will not return without settling it. It's in their blood. They only recall how Aromal was beheaded by the unbeatable Aringodan.

123
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:34,112
You despise me too, isnt it, Kuttimani ?

124
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:42,194
No need. you always despise or fear me.

125
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:48,026
No, you've always been kind.

126
00:21:49,456 --> 00:22:00,651
Kind? I'm sorry I replaced love with kindness for the last 18 years.You dont understand me either. No one does.

127
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:11,148
Not Your fault. Because I never gave you a chance. But I wish someone would understand me well now.

128
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:38,616
I was an orphan. At 5, my uncle adopted me. Now he too wants me beheaded.

129
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:53,565
I'd hoped all was forgotten. Now they come and put salt on the wound. The young generation now. Why ?

130
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:06,624
And they're blessed by my guru. My foster father. My..

131
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:39,435
Good of you to come help with the funeral, chekava

132
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:47,731
There's no one else to help, right.? I will take him.

133
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:53,994
Chekava offered to foster him when sis died., but he didnt agree.

134
00:23:54,214 --> 00:24:03,591
He was stubborn. I know he was poor, but why should he fight the Malayan for 32 gold ?

135
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:08,094
The dead should not be accused, but..

136
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:19,861
Marrying Vamakshi to Elamthalam itself was a mistake. Lets not speak anymore.We will leave.

137
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:28,026
Lets go. He's tired,carry him, Kunjammar.

138
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:47,998
The famed Puturan house. They loaned even to the Menons and goldmerchant Chettiyars. Mom tearfully recalled her childhood there.

139
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:57,184
And she'd curse the Gods for her marriage to poverty of Elamthalam.

140
00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:11,584
Their 16 schools were given 2001 gold annually by the ruler. Rulers recruited their soldiers from Puturan first.

141
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:40,078
Come, son.
This is also Your house. Here's Your aunt.

142
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:50,115
Unni, here's someone to play with.

143
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:56,068
Give it to me, it's mine.
-No I wont

144
00:25:58,901 --> 00:26:04,774
Aromal, give it to Archa.
-Dad, this was a Vishu gift to me.

145
00:26:04,993 --> 00:26:09,873
Ok, I'll give you another. Let her have it.

146
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:20,228
Aromal, this is Your cousin, Chandu.

147
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:44,418
Go play with the kids. This is home.

148
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:50,321
You have another playmate inside. Atumanmel Kunjiraman.

149
00:26:50,440 --> 00:27:05,050
Yes. The kids are ready to begin their education on Vijayadashami. you must also learn to write and fight well, eh ?

150
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:33,473
Here, kids played boardgames with real gold? For a poverty striken me, this dint feel like home,even if uncle tried.

151
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:43,073
(Prompting) Ahead.. Swing out.. Legs forward.. Kick with the right..

152
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:10,423
Move, Kunjiraman. Now I will spar with cousin.

153
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:27,825
(Prompting) Lift right knee.. Swing hip.. Ahead.. Change foot..

154
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:31,542
Enough.

155
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:37,982
You got stubborn, and lost it.

156
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:44,052
You learned up 9 basics in a month. Smart boy.

157
00:28:56,188 --> 00:28:59,113
He thinks he is great.
- Why is Chandu still here?

158
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:13,150
Dad brought him because he has no food. Many people mooch off us anyway. Let him also stay.

159
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:42,199
I prayed everyday. "Oh Goddess and war gods. Let the day come when they sing my praises as a warrior."

160
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:30,955
"Give me strength in my arms. In my weapons."

161
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:28,322
Mom, who is that child?
Thumbolarcha, from Mikavil Mikacheri.

162
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,515
You Ambady people are here too. Why did you not get Kunjunni engaged ?

163
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:42,122
The ones in a hurry can go ahead.

164
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:50,652
Where is Chandu ?

165
00:30:54,755 --> 00:31:01,323
Change Your clothes. Kunjamar ?

166
00:31:56,854 --> 00:32:13,482
Oh Child Lord Ganapathy, oh black Snake wargods !

167
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:37,879
Give them a happy marriage. Give them victory wherever they go.

168
00:33:44,110 --> 00:34:05,685
Ear pierced at 5 years age. Learnt Your alphabet at 7.
You shall learn Your skills well. Tie the knot at 10.

169
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:53,336
They're our future. They will be warriors.
Guard the land. Win the battles.

170
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:14,399
Ear pierced at 5 years age. Learnt Your alphabet at 7.
You shall learn Your skills well. Tie the knot at 10.

171
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:06,406
Bring the flowers, bring the instruments.

172
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:38,942
Bring along a thousand people to celebrate.

173
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:06,742
(Prompting)

174
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:47,203
You promised to return by year-mid. Where were you ?

175
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:57,772
I was given a good piece of land, where I built a school. 57 feet. A little bigger than this place.

176
00:37:58,053 --> 00:38:06,577
For good teachers, 50 feet will do. Your body becomes Your eyes, Your weapons become Your mind.

177
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,684
You threw out Your basics in Your hurry to build a school, didnt you Kunjirama ?

178
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:14,991
Watch him.

179
00:38:19,112 --> 00:38:20,989
So, what's special about him?

180
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:28,894
To you, a weapon is something you hold. To him, a weapon is part of his mind. That's all.

181
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:42,449
Aromal, I own 6 schools. After you master footing, I'll appoint you as guru in 3 of them.Students from afar will come on hearing Your name.

182
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:51,696
We'll take only registration fees.You can claim the tuition fees for urself.

183
00:38:56,952 --> 00:39:02,614
Chandu's the one who assists elder in his fights, isnt it?
-Sometimes.

184
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:07,564
So the nephew is teachers pet ?
-Says who ?

185
00:39:07,703 --> 00:39:16,527
The tons of praises pouring out from Your father the critic.
-Let spectators decide who's better, at the public show.

186
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:21,856
Lets keep a wager during the public show. you versus Chandu.

187
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:30,303
Winner gets a golden snake-necklace from me. The guru neednt know of this.

188
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:50,274
I know you practise alone these days.

189
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:55,981
Your dear bro is always a step ahead. I must catch up, if not beat him.

190
00:39:56,298 --> 00:40:00,087
You're already ahead. We both know that.

191
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,714
Hold on.

192
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:19,061
Checking if this is still here.

193
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:26,564
Let our 'footing' exam be done. We will work on improving Your strength.

194
00:40:27,026 --> 00:40:32,751
Someone has asked Your brother to turn the public practise into a competition.

195
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:33,641
Who?

196
00:40:33,713 --> 00:40:43,708
Whoever it is, I wont compete. Not because I'm a coward, but because this is a wrong time and place. So not now.

197
00:46:25,598 --> 00:46:27,864
Aromal !

198
00:46:51,493 --> 00:46:57,464
Competent, arent they?
The nephew is stronger.

199
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:31,401
Thats enough. Its not battle, its a show. Which of you forgot it first ?

200
00:47:52,717 --> 00:47:58,000
Now Puturan house boasts 3 Chekava warriors.

201
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:11,159
You must improve Your footing. you still have time to learn.

202
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:24,557
You must become better than Your dad. I was observing Your handsomeness, I didnt observe Your moves.

203
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:31,747
That is Puturan house. Male or female,beauty is in their blood.

204
00:48:33,673 --> 00:48:42,010
Footing is the most important thing. I think the son beats the nephew in that.

205
00:48:47,252 --> 00:48:52,540
Wait.Extend Your hand.

206
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:25,894
Did it hurt?
- Yes. But its fine. When you deviate from the planned routine show, you must declare it. Thats the rule.

207
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:32,522
Well, you must know how to defend those.
-You're Elder's son, so no one blames you. Atleast uncle knows.

208
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:39,008
Even if I declare my moves, you cannot defend them, cousin.
-Want to try now ?

209
00:49:42,782 --> 00:49:47,344
Now there's no one to appreciate Your beauty. Come.

210
00:49:50,263 --> 00:49:53,560
Chandu. Dont.

211
00:49:54,535 --> 00:50:04,710
Lower Your swords, both of you. Battle is not the way to end it. I will stop this recklessness.

212
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:43,248
The lords blabber something for the sake of it. Dont bother about it. you did well out there.

213
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:49,171
You outshined Aromal.

214
00:50:54,356 --> 00:50:56,277
I am satisfied.

215
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,138
That's all I ever need to hear.

216
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:20,930
My foster-dad, guru and god. Uncle was all that.

217
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:32,072
The ones who want to behead me, come with His blessings.

218
00:51:50,512 --> 00:51:58,660
Once, they all went to the Karivel festival. I was alone.

219
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:15,262
The beats of Uncle's praises rang in my head. My mind was satisfied, and celebrating its own festival.

220
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:31,955
Please serve dinner for me. I shall sleep early.

221
00:52:32,072 --> 00:52:36,067
Shall I heat water for Your bath?

222
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:42,949
Oh, I thought you were the Mani girl.

223
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:57,979
Shall I serve u? But can guests serve hosts? Archa might argue against that

224
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:03,435
I saw Alathoor uncle in the gallery, but couldnt spot you, Kunjunuli

225
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:12,480
You wouldnt spot me, unless I'm clad in shining swordsteel. Or so I hear from Unni-Archa

226
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:21,663
I wanted to return. But Dad made me stay.

227
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:31,672
Good. you Alathoor people rarely visit. Didnt you go to the Karivel fest ?

228
00:53:32,658 --> 00:53:44,152
That's what they invited me for.They need someone to accompany the beauty from Mikavil, dont they. But I refused.

229
00:53:45,894 --> 00:53:48,435
I din't know ThumbolArcha had come either.

230
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:54,349
Not personally. She sent her servants to announce arrival.

231
00:53:58,065 --> 00:54:01,690
Did it hurt ?
-Its just a cut. Not a problem.

232
00:54:06,262 --> 00:54:15,545
I wanted to give you a gift. Didnt know if it was appropriate custom for a girl to gift at the competition.

233
00:54:20,265 --> 00:54:21,813
So I..

234
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:33,614
No thanks. I dont like these formalities.

235
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:41,848
Please leave, Kunjunuli. If Mani sees this..

236
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,251
Or is it UnniArcha you fear?

237
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:56,574
Yes. I have to live with her someday.
- And you think Archa feels the same way?

238
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:44,048
"Who wears the scent of sandalwood. Is it the wind, or my lover?"

239
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:59,621
"Who opens the box of kajal now, is it youth itself, is it a Goddess ?"

240
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:49,019
"Who does those red lips of yours await today?"

241
00:56:52,969 --> 00:57:02,093
"Your morning prayers are over. Which other God will you worship now?

242
00:57:05,373 --> 00:57:19,932
"Behind your garments, does the pleasure of your bodice awaits my eyes?"

243
00:57:26,032 --> 00:57:30,901
"Who wears the scent of sandalwood. Is it the wind, or my lover?"

244
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:11,340
"The jewellery you dorn, to me they are arrows from Cupid's quiver."

245
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:22,529
"The pleats of your garment, why do they playing a game on my eyes ?"

246
00:58:27,109 --> 00:58:37,555
"Her hip-necklace fell away, and the young lass, she stole my heart away".

247
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:55,471
"Who wears the scent of sandalwood. Is it the wind, or my lover?"

248
00:59:33,467 --> 00:59:36,697
I'm done. You can enter now

249
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:55,005
Is Dad done with his prayers? I am ready to leave now.
- To go where?

250
00:59:56,537 --> 01:00:03,991
Attumanmel. Arent you coming? They are installing an idol in the school. Aromal will teach there.

251
01:00:08,677 --> 01:00:14,660
I didnt know this. I'm going somewhere too. Elantalam house.

252
01:00:17,795 --> 01:00:21,873
So Attumanamel?
-Not coming. No one invited me.

253
01:00:26,107 --> 01:00:31,298
Does a warrior need an invite to a martial arts school? Is'nt it his right ?

254
01:00:32,897 --> 01:00:38,859
So says logic. I have work at Elanthalam. Kunjammar can manage the rituals at the school here.

255
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:51,004
What will you do there alone ?
-Well, someday people will be living there, right?

256
01:00:58,993 --> 01:00:59,879
Archa

257
01:01:02,606 --> 01:01:06,187
Archa,your make-up will delay us.

258
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:13,591
The big puja will be done by the lord of Trichambar.

259
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:53,549
So you have come.

260
01:01:56,191 --> 01:02:00,775
For a few days. I wanted to clean up the house.

261
01:02:02,439 --> 01:02:09,434
You must start up a school. Else the kids need to cross the river to learn.And that boatman cannot manage.

262
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:20,797
I will start at an auspicious time. I wanted to ask you, can you lend me 500 gold? Need to buy furniture and vessels.

263
01:02:21,831 --> 01:02:28,311
Wont Puthooran grant you furniture and vessels, when they give their single daughter? Has the date been fixed?

264
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,290
No, uncle has not mentioned to me.

265
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:44,803
I have seen her once.She is royal and beautiful.The stars shine well upon you.

266
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:52,806
You may come to Puthanmalika for the money. Let lack of money not delay Your marriage.

267
01:02:57,659 --> 01:02:59,498
Summon the architect.

268
01:03:02,022 --> 01:03:05,280
The Elder asked you to come.
- Why, cant they manage well there?

269
01:03:05,773 --> 01:03:07,858
He didnt mention.

270
01:03:33,483 --> 01:03:38,479
Did Aunty tell u?
-No, I just arrived.

271
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:46,245
There was work at the school. And I cleaned the house.

272
01:03:46,245 --> 01:03:57,185
Before flagging off Aromal's school, we must get Archa wed.

273
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:07,147
When they asked her horoscope, Aromal gave it to them.
- To whom?

274
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:15,625
Aromal did it all. He matched it with Kunjiraman's and fixed a marriage date for them.

275
01:04:22,182 --> 01:04:27,291
Not because they didnt remember about you.

276
01:04:31,698 --> 01:04:36,134
We could rein him when he was a kid. Now we are old.

277
01:04:36,134 --> 01:04:50,960
I had to argue and fight him, asking him to honor his word to his friend. Aunty will tell you.

278
01:04:56,139 --> 01:05:05,039
Son..
-I think I heard enough aunt.

279
01:05:10,763 --> 01:05:17,669
Did she agree as well, UnniKanna? Your sister.

280
01:05:20,696 --> 01:05:25,025
Yes, and no.

281
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:16,599
No one told me you came. Did Dad tell u?

282
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:28,359
Aromal fixed everything.
-And you agreed to it and closed the chapter.

283
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:41,784
I know Elanthalam is not grand enough to fancy a relation with Puthooran. But still my house and school are ready.

284
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:47,802
I loaned money for it.The architect wouldve prepared the wood by now.

285
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:51,060
Chandu..
- Di, you are my...

286
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,921
When brother Aromal insists..
- You must obey him.

287
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:12,055
I have only 1 sister.The bro must plan for her future. 5 farms, 6000 bags of rice, 1 inheritor. Need I ask for more?

288
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:21,409
Cousin,I was engaged to her in our youth.
-That was just an old-fashioned custom to fool the kids

289
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:33,076
So anyone may give a word of engagement, then go back on it? Is it Puthooran custom, or one of all warriors ?

290
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:37,628
Can brother or sister give me an explanation behind this ?

291
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:56,636
21 gold. Its the only binding term in the contract. That account was to be closed before marriage, and I have done it now.

292
01:07:56,917 --> 01:08:00,079
It is for you to know too.

293
01:08:02,763 --> 01:08:06,812
A Chekava settles accounts with swordsteel, not gold. Come.

294
01:08:10,026 --> 01:08:12,263
Bro, dont.
- Move away !

295
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:27,460
Aromal, no !

296
01:10:28,022 --> 01:10:30,588
Stop I say.

297
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,758
Just because he said something in anger?

298
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:41,061
Are you cousins, or monsters?

299
01:10:46,217 --> 01:10:55,864
Both of you, shake your hands and say your apologies.
Are my words falling on deaf ears?

300
01:12:55,318 --> 01:13:09,060
Did my grudge ever die? Frankly, no. She was my love, my thoughts, the hope that ran through my blood since I was 13.

301
01:13:10,482 --> 01:13:14,857
That is what they made me forsake.

302
01:13:21,696 --> 01:13:37,045
Maybe her cousin Chandu didnt deserve her. I wished her to have a good life.

303
01:14:00,407 --> 01:14:10,489
The marriage went well?Dont worry, there r good girls for you out there.

304
01:14:15,025 --> 01:14:17,028
Let us find one.

305
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:27,231
Chandu insisted I come

306
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:31,375
Why didnt you turn up for the marriage?

307
01:14:31,454 --> 01:14:41,135
I was at Tulucheri
- Thankfully the marriage plans are moving on.

308
01:14:58,262 --> 01:15:02,345
I have not seen Your daughter, Alathoor.

309
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:09,165
She's my only daughter.Since Archa is wed,let's not delay this.

310
01:15:09,165 --> 01:15:20,680
That's what I told Chandu too. He has been unlucky so far,like uncle.

311
01:15:22,913 --> 01:15:30,493
Yea. Kannappan told me they'd be here before noon.You people left before them, isnt it ?

312
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:36,624
They said there'd be 16 people for lunch, so they should turn up soon.

313
01:15:36,624 --> 01:15:43,635
We came for..
-Yes, I know, the cousin came instead of the Father.

314
01:15:52,498 --> 01:15:58,224
Dad, ask them if I should bring coconut water?
-Bring them water to wash themselves.

315
01:15:58,224 --> 01:16:10,369
My daughter is lucky.The Mikavil people tried hard, but ThumbolArcha's horoscope did not match Aromal.

316
01:16:12,021 --> 01:16:17,953
But as fate had it, Kunjunuli's horoscope did match.

317
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:38,815
Your nephew came early.
- Understandably. By custom, the cousin is the one who is at the forefront of organizing.

318
01:16:38,815 --> 01:16:44,758
The cousin must accompany Aromal throughout the wedding. Thats custom.

319
01:16:44,758 --> 01:16:46,038
Please sit inside.

320
01:18:16,322 --> 01:18:22,514
Enough. I'm convinced. What more can Aringodan's school teach u?

321
01:18:23,775 --> 01:18:28,695
They say a Chekava warrior keeps learning until death.

322
01:18:29,611 --> 01:18:33,960
No one generally likes that last lesson.

323
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:40,247
I've never seen your famed broadsword styles. And the southern arts.

324
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:47,963
.. are mere Aringodan tricks. That's what your uncle gossips.

325
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:14,047
Who's your enemy?You came here despite mastering the Puthooran slashing style, so your enemy is powerful.

326
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:17,351
I have none, now.

327
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:26,161
Keep the fees.
Take them.

328
01:19:30,457 --> 01:19:55,596
Thats my daughter, Kunji.

329
01:19:55,596 --> 01:20:07,571
I used to live with my daughter, and now a daughter-in-law joined me. Kuttimani. Chandu, you may live inside the palace.

330
01:20:07,571 --> 01:20:12,306
No need.I can easily reach by early morning.

331
01:20:12,306 --> 01:20:16,643
You may decide as you wish.

332
01:21:01,336 --> 01:21:08,841
So you now see that Aringodans dont do magic tricks?

333
01:21:08,841 --> 01:21:13,509
Your education was incomplete.You chekavas have never faced challenges as big as elephants.

334
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:20,531
When people ask me if I can tame them,I dont deny either.

335
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:57,150
"Is it the light of a lamp ? Is it the Labernum flower in bloom"

336
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:27,685
"Does he come from the sky? Is it the rising sun behind the hills?"

337
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:17,871
"The beauty of his jet black hair, and the strength of his arms"

338
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:49,917
"The shapely neck, like a conch. The built body"

339
01:23:53,254 --> 01:24:03,053
"Does he come from the sky? Is it the rising sun behind the hills?"

340
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:44,602
"The legs with the snake bracelet"

341
01:24:44,602 --> 01:24:49,505
"The warriors beauty on his face"

342
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:14,738
"Who is the battle hero whose presence fills the arena"

343
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:18,683
Where to ?

344
01:26:18,683 --> 01:26:28,620
Is UnniArcha at Puthooran or at her husbands house?
- I do not know.

345
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:37,115
Is Aromal's wedding over?
- Tomorrow.

346
01:26:37,115 --> 01:26:40,319
U've been enquiring on Karuthenar land news.

347
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:47,002
News from famed lands travels fast to our doorsteps.

348
01:26:47,002 --> 01:26:55,805
Ive been wanting to see Archa ever since I heard of her defeating the men at Nagapuram.

349
01:26:55,805 --> 01:27:03,725
People wonder why she wed that transsexual, Kunjiraman.

350
01:27:03,725 --> 01:27:07,988
Who wonder? The people, or u? Here's the answer.

351
01:27:07,988 --> 01:27:24,452
All girls, including you, you see what no one does. You curse while you flirt. Cry while you laugh. Love while you hate.

352
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:32,608
If you have any more tactics, please teach me.

353
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:43,392
And this curiosity to enquire news? That's another tactic. Dont try it against me.

354
01:28:22,317 --> 01:28:27,698
I will return day after tomorrow evening.

355
01:28:27,698 --> 01:28:36,486
I didnt meant to scold you. Sometimes a madness takes me, and I feel like shouting.

356
01:28:36,486 --> 01:28:41,187
Please dont misunderstand. I take my leave.

357
01:30:13,422 --> 01:30:16,726
Chandu, are you still at Elanthalam now?
- Sometimes.

358
01:30:16,726 --> 01:30:24,152
Someone told me the place is closed. I teach at Pudushery school now, you know. The lord insisted.

359
01:30:24,193 --> 01:30:28,279
Pays me 1000 at the beginning, and 1001 at the end.
- Very good for you.

360
01:30:29,139 --> 01:30:34,004
Archa is planning to set up a marriage for you with someone

361
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:44,791
Aunty, I shall..
- No, dont leave. There's a dinner feast tonight.

362
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:52,638
Then another feast tomorrow morning. No one's waiting for you back there, so dont run away.

363
01:31:36,022 --> 01:31:43,784
So you escaped to Tulunadu during my marriage. Well timed, how convenient.

364
01:31:47,046 --> 01:31:51,097
How long do you plan to be a loner?
- As long as possible.

365
01:31:52,638 --> 01:32:00,547
Dont you need someone to atleast cook for u?
- I love cooking my own food these days.

366
01:32:07,983 --> 01:32:23,134
Perhaps Your horoscope matches that of ThumbolArcha? Why didnt anyone think of that? Even I hadnt. Shall I enquire?
-No need

367
01:32:24,746 --> 01:32:33,095
Theyre still on good terms with us. The marriage plans were changed because Aromal's horoscope didnt match.

368
01:32:33,095 --> 01:32:39,936
Or is it that the gold in Mikavil is much lower compared to Alathoor uncles ?

369
01:32:41,747 --> 01:32:52,449
Its not for wealth that I... I only did it because Aromal.
-Enough. Its history now. I dont want a narration.

370
01:33:01,213 --> 01:33:07,057
Do you think they showered me in pearls and covered me with gold in that palace?

371
01:33:09,549 --> 01:33:14,610
They consider servants a waste of money,so I do all the work.

372
01:33:15,211 --> 01:33:22,180
Is that all ?
-I have to ask a hundred persmissions to cross the gate.

373
01:33:23,712 --> 01:33:36,716
I must lift every pail of water I bathe with. And when I try to practise my sword slashing, the sound echoes in the house.

374
01:33:38,888 --> 01:33:45,596
Mother advised me not to practise anymore.

375
01:33:53,173 --> 01:34:01,173
Beyond Kumarom river,Elanthalam is close, isnt it?
-Maybe

376
01:34:03,224 --> 01:34:17,746
Why dont you come to me once in a while? In the night at the river, you can hear the sound of passing boats.

377
01:34:23,771 --> 01:34:33,404
Kunjiraman is at Pudusheri 4 days a week.
- I know. He told me his salary too.

378
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:52,033
Do you hate me so much ? There isn't a single day I didnt think of you. It's all my bad luck.

379
01:35:18,271 --> 01:35:23,348
Do come. I will keep the backdoor open

380
01:35:55,863 --> 01:35:57,849
You are blushing a lot

381
01:36:26,513 --> 01:36:39,617
"The crescent moon has opened her eyes.
Now the day has become complete"

382
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:53,868
"Gradually, she casts her spell. Gracefully, she enters the lover's chariot"

383
01:37:59,585 --> 01:38:06,583
"Where are the heavenly nymphs? Where are the escorts with golden fans?"

384
01:38:20,596 --> 01:38:29,096
"Like a thousand volcanoes in unision, the song sang..."

385
01:38:29,406 --> 01:38:33,849
"The crescent moon has opened her eyes.
Now the day has become complete"

386
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:43,125
"Gradually, she casts her spell. Gracefully, she enters the lover's chariot"

387
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:34,817
"Who's illusion of hope is this?
Who's song of expression is this "

388
01:39:50,006 --> 01:39:55,855
"In a thousand colours, the night dressed herself"

389
01:40:58,214 --> 01:41:02,844
Even yesterday I stayed awake, thinking of you.

390
01:41:09,555 --> 01:41:12,435
Archa..

391
01:41:18,256 --> 01:41:24,383
Get out you indecent fellow. Did you think there were no men in this house ?

392
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:32,903
Savage !

393
01:41:35,045 --> 01:41:43,072
I opened the backdoor thinking it was you, and he...

394
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:15,327
That night Chandu earned another title."He who swam a river, rode a horse, to enter a married womans chamber"

395
01:42:15,327 --> 01:42:21,290
"The nymphomaniac, sex-hungry Chandu"

396
01:42:29,649 --> 01:42:34,936
(Chanting)

397
01:43:04,318 --> 01:43:15,765
I am Unichandror, the lord of Kurungattu land in Melur. I have an issue with with my cousin Unikoonar, regarding land.

398
01:43:15,765 --> 01:43:32,491
You may sit and tell me. Start from the beginning.

399
01:43:41,552 --> 01:43:47,433
What is it ?
-Dont worry. They come not to attack, but request.

400
01:43:47,433 --> 01:43:52,029
Chandu, come here.

401
01:43:55,733 --> 01:44:07,180
Do you hear? It started when the ex-ruler of Kurungattu died.He had a son each from 2 wives, but they do not know who is elder.

402
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:18,423
They gambled gold and silver to settle this, but his cousin won. They had a cock-fight, and he won that too.
- Bad luck..

403
01:44:18,423 --> 01:44:27,912
I know.
- He is a cheat and a liar. He had once agreed in public that I am elder.

404
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:38,284
In the vendetta that followed, Unichandror lost 4 men.
- And Unikonar lost 8 men.

405
01:44:38,284 --> 01:44:46,624
So they want to settle this by trial by combat. And they want me as their champion

406
01:44:46,624 --> 01:44:55,675
The ruler suggested it was better this way. Trial by combat, rather than all-out vendetta with many innocent casualties.

407
01:44:55,675 --> 01:45:02,564
True. Then there'd be only 1 innocent dead.
- Warrior,thats the way its handled, isnt it?

408
01:45:02,564 --> 01:45:14,436
Yes, thats all a warrior does - kill or die. I am too old for this, better a youngsters. This one's good, he is skilled.

409
01:45:14,436 --> 01:45:14,618
Chandu.

410
01:45:17,777 --> 01:45:24,461
I have not heard of you.
- Nephew of Puthooran, and now my disciple .

411
01:45:24,461 --> 01:45:36,812
Oh, from Elanthalam. Son of the guy who the Malayan killed.
- Yes.

412
01:45:36,929 --> 01:45:45,433
I prefer Aringodan. Then I can rest assured of victory. That's what people tell me.

413
01:45:48,078 --> 01:45:54,583
Did they tell you I try magic tricks on the enemy?

414
01:45:59,233 --> 01:46:04,768
Where is the arena built?
-In Prajapati land, near the city wall.

415
01:46:06,243 --> 01:46:13,623
Who is Unikonar's champion?
-He is searching in other warrior schools.

416
01:46:13,623 --> 01:46:25,150
Bring the battle-gold on Monday. Today is not auspicious. Kelu, tell them the price and formalities. Monday.

417
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:29,630
May you live long.

418
01:46:51,517 --> 01:46:54,431
Father
- A sword was forged somewhere to behead me.

419
01:47:11,255 --> 01:47:14,615
In battle or not, the sword will find me. So how does it matter ?

420
01:47:22,759 --> 01:47:33,567
Kunji, I have warned you - no flirting or crying in this house. There will be a Ganapathy puja on Monday.

421
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:41,414
51 lamps in the temple. One for every year that I lived to tell the tale. 51.

422
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:52,079
And these lords squabble over their banana trees and jackfruits.

423
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:57,180
Alas, I was born to die, a Chekava warrior.

424
01:48:37,709 --> 01:48:44,521
Dont be scared, you heard what Dad said. I wouldve gone instead of Your Dad.

425
01:48:44,541 --> 01:48:52,193
I didnt mean that.
-1 day I have to.But these people came specifically for Your Dad.

426
01:48:52,193 --> 01:49:00,132
Please go to assist him.
- Let Your Dad decide on that. He has many good disciples.

427
01:49:00,132 --> 01:49:07,201
He doesnt trust their skills much. Maybe thats his nature.

428
01:49:07,201 --> 01:49:17,478
Only one who knows the Aringodan well know him truly. He's used to projecting his harsh image. Too late to change that.

429
01:49:17,478 --> 01:49:23,882
He likes you, Chandu. He considers it lucky you joined him. Right?

430
01:49:23,882 --> 01:49:27,899
Yes, but the real luck is your's.

431
01:49:25,369 --> 01:49:28,549
But the daughter is the really lucky one here.

432
01:49:43,153 --> 01:49:50,166
Will you go assist Dad, as I had asked?
- Let us see when the time comes

433
01:50:09,597 --> 01:50:13,020
May you live long.
- What news, friend

434
01:50:13,070 --> 01:50:19,196
They didnt stop even after I sang praises your praises.
- Who ?

435
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:26,071
The Elder-younger issue. Unikonar has approached Puthooran house.

436
01:50:27,669 --> 01:50:31,489
This is going to be trouble

437
01:50:56,557 --> 01:51:03,325
Only one child, Aromal, lives here. He isnt fully trained Chekava yet. And I'm not too old, so I shall come.

438
01:51:03,325 --> 01:51:09,859
Those who approach Puthooran never return empty handed.

439
01:51:12,756 --> 01:51:22,956
Well then. If you need someone to face the Aringodan and his magic tricks, search elsewhere.

440
01:51:47,127 --> 01:51:55,337
Please sit, lord. Those who do not stand up to honor my Dad, need not do the same for me.

441
01:51:55,763 --> 01:52:00,560
We..
- Pay the battle fee. I shall come.

442
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:07,249
Aromal
- They come in search of me. Its not right to say no.

443
01:52:49,360 --> 01:53:02,912
As per custom, here is the gold for the land.
Gold for the house. And your battle gold.

444
01:53:05,165 --> 01:53:10,542
This will scarcely be enough to send letters to my relatives.

445
01:53:18,701 --> 01:53:23,881
Still not enough for a Ganapathy puja.

446
01:53:34,056 --> 01:53:40,634
Now, its barely enough for my battle outfits.

447
01:53:49,118 --> 01:53:52,049
For this much, one of my students will do.

448
01:53:57,894 --> 01:53:58,626
For this,I shall send my cousin Chandu. He is equivalent to me.

449
01:54:03,361 --> 01:54:04,439
You may fix your fee as you wish.
- 100 bags of 1001 gold, if you insist on Aromal coming.

450
01:54:53,174 --> 01:55:03,707
I came to know.
- I want you to assist him. Only then will i feel secure.

451
01:55:07,593 --> 01:55:18,588
In the battle at Alathiyoor, I still remember you spotted and warned me of the enemy's fake footing and diversions.

452
01:55:18,588 --> 01:55:26,946
You were only 17 then. Later...
- Later I joined you for 3 more battles, Uncle.

453
01:55:26,965 --> 01:55:36,680
Aromal doesnt lack in skill. But, that cannot win a battle.
-But, Uncle, I...

454
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:47,353
Ure the best choice, to spot, parry and shield the enemy moves. I decided on you the moment he took the fee.

455
01:55:47,353 --> 01:55:54,877
What did Aromal say?
- What can he ? I am the one who decides.

456
01:55:54,877 --> 01:56:00,965
He was only unsure whether you're too angry to help him.

457
01:56:00,965 --> 01:56:08,461
He's my nephew, I brought him up. How can he be angry?

458
01:56:09,973 --> 01:56:15,531
Since he took the battle gold, we should not lack in celebrations and customs.

459
01:56:15,531 --> 01:56:23,446
The invitations should go to every land accessible.I will tell the ruler personally.

460
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:32,126
He is in his school, observing his fast. Go meet him.

461
01:56:56,032 --> 01:57:05,965
While we young men live, it's a shame to send my father into battle. Dont you worry.

462
01:57:05,965 --> 01:57:10,809
This is the fee we took to sell you off, brother. Why give it to me?

463
01:57:10,809 --> 01:57:16,966
If I am destined to die,may it be in battle. Whats wrong.

464
01:57:16,966 --> 01:57:23,730
I bargained gold from the lord, enough for 3 generations of Puthooran. you saw?

465
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:26,106
May you live long.

466
01:57:28,098 --> 01:57:31,451
May the battle gods bless us.

467
01:57:32,942 --> 01:57:43,230
Uncle insisted I assist you.
- Dad told me. But only fighters who are slow to catch the enemy's moves, need an assistant.

468
01:57:47,353 --> 01:57:50,617
But you will do.

469
01:58:09,686 --> 01:58:13,512
Can I enter?
- Ladies must not enter when the fast is observed.

470
01:58:13,807 --> 01:58:18,129
I saw UnniArcha entered the school.
- I dont know.

471
01:58:18,129 --> 01:58:23,164
If something happens to him..
- Nothing will happen.

472
01:58:24,204 --> 01:58:29,912
If it does,it'll be her loss. I must tell her.
- Who's?

473
01:58:29,912 --> 01:58:34,803
Must I mention? The beauty ThumbolArcha.
- But she is'nt married to Aromal.

474
01:58:34,803 --> 01:58:43,834
Really? So have'nt you heard stories of why Aromal goes there in the nights,on the pretext of gambling?

475
01:58:44,236 --> 01:58:51,983
It seems she has a daughter.
- So this is how honourable those Mikavil folk are.

476
01:58:52,787 --> 01:59:03,676
They began respecting my feelings only recently. But just when I was finding peace, this lord arrives.

477
01:59:04,757 --> 01:59:10,249
Be courageous. Its all fate, Kunjunuli.

478
01:59:17,923 --> 01:59:30,248
Even I wonder about fate. Back then that day, you were a bit late to decide, were'nt you.

479
01:59:31,277 --> 01:59:37,583
Yes. I was late for many things. It's alright now.

480
02:00:04,777 --> 02:00:07,175
Chandu

481
02:00:13,476 --> 02:00:18,885
I am the one always making the mistake.

482
02:00:24,441 --> 02:00:26,787
Stay away.

483
02:00:27,434 --> 02:00:32,615
I know your tricks well.

484
02:00:33,488 --> 02:00:37,275
Now you can start crying. But it wont work.

485
02:00:37,413 --> 02:00:47,722
Whatever you think of me... Dad told me you agreed to assist Aromal. Thank goodness.

486
02:00:48,135 --> 02:00:56,315
I only listened while Uncle asked. I've not decided yet.
- Please do go.When bro enters battle,u must assist.

487
02:00:57,708 --> 02:01:10,668
Its my request, too.
That day,I found no other way to avoid a scandal.

488
02:01:14,859 --> 02:01:20,417
I am still alone.
- I know. When I think of it...

489
02:01:21,213 --> 02:01:29,154
Well, why worry? You once spoke of a good wedding plan for me, didnt u? ThumbolArcha from Mikavil?

490
02:01:29,154 --> 02:01:35,262
Haven't you recommend me to Aunty yet?
- That..

491
02:01:40,542 --> 02:01:50,802
I am okay with it. What say ?
- Brother has started 'visiting' there.

492
02:01:57,490 --> 02:02:10,398
Please go assist brother, make sure he is in no danger. Its my request. I will do anything for that.

493
02:02:13,332 --> 02:02:18,312
Anything?
- Anything.

494
02:02:20,452 --> 02:02:31,037
If you win the battle, I'll be Your girl from that day on. I promise.

495
02:02:37,475 --> 02:02:41,581
Arent you pregnant now?

496
02:02:42,229 --> 02:02:51,139
Thats my fate. Once upon a time, I'd dreamt of bearing your son, secretively.

497
02:02:51,975 --> 02:03:02,207
Why else would I invite you into my bedroom? Even there, my calculations failed.

498
02:03:13,170 --> 02:03:25,844
After the battle, I will tell them this was my promised for the battle. Let Dad and bro undo the marriage.

499
02:03:28,456 --> 02:03:34,510
Some day, UnniArcha's word must be honored.
- Promise?

500
02:03:34,853 --> 02:03:43,274
Promise. On the goddess, on the snake battle-gods, on my Father. I promise.

501
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,950
Archa

502
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:43,419
Shall I tell Mom and sis-in-law that you've agreed to assist? They can rest peacefully then.

503
02:05:22,653 --> 02:05:35,405
The smith in Kolathiri is skilled.Get him to forge the sword. The fee is 10 gold. Give him 6 more, and a dhoti.

504
02:05:36,856 --> 02:05:48,542
The lord and people will come to send you off for battle. We will join, too. Chandu, you shall wait at Kizhur.

505
02:05:49,062 --> 02:05:55,945
Ok.
- The arena is near the city wall. Inspect it beforehand. I know I need not ask you.

506
02:05:56,356 --> 02:05:59,357
It's a common battle tactic to cheat people by placing broken flooring.

507
02:05:59,357 --> 02:06:03,815
I know. In that battle at Therotta, there was that broken floorplank once.

508
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:11,505
So you have still not forgotten that battle, eh.
- I've forgotten nothing.

509
02:07:48,506 --> 02:07:51,262
Yes?
- Your opponent is..

510
02:07:51,262 --> 02:08:05,097
I know. But I'd hoped to face Kannappan himself. We must resolve who is greater. Not this time, I guess.

511
02:08:06,278 --> 02:08:13,184
I will be assisting Aromal.
- Treachery. you learnt all of Aringodans moves,and now..

512
02:08:13,184 --> 02:08:19,008
He is his cousin. It's required of him.

513
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:33,034
I have never feared battle. But this time..

514
02:08:34,074 --> 02:08:38,348
Had you not considered me Your guru as well?
- Yes.

515
02:08:38,667 --> 02:08:44,183
Do you pray for me?
- Yes

516
02:08:46,255 --> 02:08:50,623
Then whose victory do you pray for now?

517
02:08:53,074 --> 02:08:59,069
Because both combatants usually never win.

518
02:09:01,129 --> 02:09:05,720
Need not reply.

519
02:09:11,683 --> 02:09:22,887
If you have time, console my daughters. I'd hoped to get them settled earlier.

520
02:10:24,489 --> 02:10:32,435
Coconut water to drink?
- No. I need to meet the blacksmith. I'd met Your Dad.

521
02:10:35,296 --> 02:10:43,261
Why dont you sit?
- I will be assisting Aromal.

522
02:10:47,353 --> 02:10:57,941
Was'nt it Aromal who spoilt your wedding once?
-Yes, but he is my cousin. Uncle insisted.

523
02:10:59,125 --> 02:11:04,799
Did she insist too? She.
- Archa? Yes.

524
02:11:04,799 --> 02:11:13,947
She still has the brave Chekava at her fingertips.
- Stop, woman. Enough relationship advice.

525
02:11:14,478 --> 02:11:19,025
She knows well that when she whistles to her faithful dog, this brave one will run to her, tail in between legs.

526
02:11:26,871 --> 02:11:32,310
Your Dad is fasting. Pray for him. It will be more useful than Your blabbering.

527
02:11:39,958 --> 02:11:47,752
Please stop. I blabbered as a woman does. My mistake.
- Its ok.

528
02:11:48,954 --> 02:11:56,348
I had hoped you'd assist Dad. But instead, you ended up assisting the opponent, so I lost it.

529
02:11:58,570 --> 02:12:10,385
If something happens to Dad, I will be alone.Dad is waiting for Your approval,do you know?

530
02:12:11,135 --> 02:12:22,282
Approval for what?
- Dad agreed he would conduct the marriage anytime. But he does'nt know how to ask favors.

531
02:12:23,022 --> 02:12:32,453
He guessed correctly what I wished. But some other people realize it only if I shout it out.

532
02:12:50,184 --> 02:12:58,648
I'll always be here to help you 2 and your Dad. After all, he too is my guru.

533
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:09,766
Will you accept it? For my Dad atleast?
- This is'nt the time to decide, Kunji. I should leave now.

534
02:14:41,527 --> 02:14:43,712
Live long.

535
02:14:52,864 --> 02:15:00,956
I requested the blacksmith to forge it well, using whatever material was required

536
02:15:00,956 --> 02:15:07,234
They a good blade should even cut an elephants tusks.

537
02:15:18,953 --> 02:15:23,401
(Prompting) Defend on backfoot, jump and turn..

538
02:15:26,298 --> 02:15:30,662
Swing backfoot and turn back to face enemy

539
02:15:33,425 --> 02:15:37,786
Swing to the left, then right, jump and slash down

540
02:16:21,379 --> 02:16:26,655
The Aringodan cheated his move, thats why Chandu stopped his stab.

541
02:16:27,442 --> 02:16:36,042
Opponent. I saw that you cheated.
- When you see unexpected moves, dont call it cheating.

542
02:16:36,042 --> 02:16:42,093
How untrained you are.
-Lets see how well I trained.

543
02:16:52,589 --> 02:16:57,819
The first 2 rounds were neck-to-neck. Now this tiebreaker round will decide.

544
02:17:30,809 --> 02:17:34,868
Swing and slash. Swing and sidestep.

545
02:18:53,035 --> 02:18:57,926
Give me the replacement sword, Chandu.
- I need time to get the weapon.

546
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:09,875
Aringodan, stop. Wait till I get the replacement sword. Its the rule.

547
02:19:44,124 --> 02:19:48,707
Stop, Aringodan. Wait until the replacement arrives.

548
02:20:51,257 --> 02:20:57,434
Unikonar, you may claim your land. Puthooran Aromal has won the battle.

549
02:20:58,272 --> 02:21:04,170
Those who wish to see Aringodan's dead body, come onto the arena.

550
02:22:19,723 --> 02:22:23,599
The cut..
- Is not very deep. It's okay.

551
02:22:23,599 --> 02:22:33,028
The blacksmith cheated us. But the battle gods were on our side. What treachery !

552
02:22:33,479 --> 02:22:38,072
Was it the blacksmith who betrayed, or you, cousin?

553
02:22:44,961 --> 02:22:50,911
Tell the truth.
- Aromal, I wanted you to win this, even more than you did.

554
02:22:50,911 --> 02:22:53,308
I'd always told them you would betray, Chandu.

555
02:22:59,372 --> 02:23:04,620
If they ask me why I killed my assistant, this broken sword will give them an answer.

556
02:23:04,919 --> 02:23:09,439
Stop. If you want to fight me, we shall fix a venue and time, but later.

557
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:15,208
If I can defeat Aringodan with half a sword, a quartersword will do for you.

558
02:23:58,211 --> 02:23:59,646
Aromal

559
02:24:02,927 --> 02:24:07,434
Lord, Chandu has betrayed me.

560
02:25:10,623 --> 02:25:13,610
Please spare me.

561
02:25:14,895 --> 02:25:20,218
Who bribed you to botch up the sword by replacing the nail. Tell me.

562
02:25:23,256 --> 02:25:25,244
How much did the Aringodan bribe?

563
02:25:25,244 --> 02:25:30,256
Even Aringodan does'nt know of this. We were asked to keep mum about it.

564
02:25:30,256 --> 02:25:35,045
Who asked you to do this?
- The Aringodan's daughter.

565
02:25:44,103 --> 02:25:51,151
When I heard who the opponent was, I hoped the replacement sword would be good enough.

566
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:11,726
Where is that guy, Chandu?
- He has not come here.

567
02:26:11,726 --> 02:26:13,674
Close the gates.

568
02:26:24,162 --> 02:26:27,139
Move away. Where is she?
- You shall not pass.

569
02:26:27,245 --> 02:26:31,873
Call her out, the traitor who bribed the smith to mess up the sword.

570
02:26:32,267 --> 02:26:36,760
Aromal is the one who cheated. And you stood watching.

571
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:40,955
How Puthooran it is to throw a halfsword when a battle is paused.

572
02:29:12,168 --> 02:29:13,298
Oh God

573
02:29:17,634 --> 02:29:19,767
Where is she?
- Please dont

574
02:29:27,462 --> 02:29:30,887
Kunji. Open the door.

575
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:22,558
Archa, what happened is

576
02:31:22,558 --> 02:31:26,786
I can guess what happened, from your face.

577
02:31:28,071 --> 02:31:30,309
Atleast you must know the truth, Archa.

578
02:31:30,309 --> 02:31:38,890
You betrayed my bro, as well as me, who you were engaged to.

579
02:31:48,734 --> 02:31:59,250
If my child is a boy, my brother asked to name it after him. I hope it is a boy.

580
02:31:59,250 --> 02:32:04,924
Archa, listen to me
- No. I dont want to listen or see you anymore

581
02:32:08,963 --> 02:32:17,604
Traitor Chandu. My son will come visit you one day. To avenge his uncle's death.

582
02:32:21,384 --> 02:32:28,133
I promise. On the battle gods, on my dead brother.

583
02:32:58,521 --> 02:33:01,487
Aromal's son and nephew

584
02:33:04,528 --> 02:33:07,363
I am scared.

585
02:33:35,013 --> 02:33:38,769
Kuttimani. Light the lamp in the battle room.

586
02:36:25,362 --> 02:36:28,815
Kuttimani, you may leave

587
02:36:37,364 --> 02:36:43,798
The fight isnt over yet, warrior. Grandfather has taught us more moves.

588
02:36:45,458 --> 02:36:52,684
You call this battle? I humored a game with you immature kids, and you call it battle?

589
02:36:52,684 --> 02:36:59,044
I simply dodged and shielded myself from Your cuts, without a fight.Are you not trained enough to realize, kids?

590
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:08,635
What other move? The old Puthooran one where you 'fool an enemy into feeling secure, and then trick him'?

591
02:37:08,635 --> 02:37:15,294
Or the new trick from the Kuruppans, where you fling sand into a defending fighter's eyes ?

592
02:37:15,323 --> 02:37:18,487
Take up Your weapon

593
02:37:21,634 --> 02:37:26,076
You cannot defeat Chandu

594
02:37:27,064 --> 02:37:32,144
In life, I've been defeated. Many times. By many people.

595
02:37:36,554 --> 02:37:40,110
My dad first defeated me, when he died at the Malayan's hands.

596
02:37:40,110 --> 02:37:43,982
Then my guru, who feared to show me impartial love.

597
02:37:44,212 --> 02:37:55,329
The girl I loved, as she traded off my love for another's gold. Then finally, my friend, who didnt believe me.

598
02:37:57,296 --> 02:38:01,628
Still Chandu lives on, waiting to be defeated again.

599
02:38:02,194 --> 02:38:06,913
Return
- Aromal's son and nephew didnt come to return defeated

600
02:38:06,913 --> 02:38:14,452
There is no man alive who can beat traitor Chandu. Not by skill, not by strength. No one. You may return.

601
02:38:14,596 --> 02:38:22,965
Kill me if you will. UnniArcha's son has come prepared to die honorably in battle if need be.

602
02:38:23,790 --> 02:38:26,626
Take up your weapon

603
02:39:23,728 --> 02:39:33,704
You must not fail, children. Here ends the story of the traitor Chandu.

604
02:39:35,594 --> 02:39:39,196
Here begins the legend of Aromal Unni who avenged the honor of Puthooran house.

605
02:40:11,046 --> 02:40:14,896
Place my head at your mothers feet, and bow to her. Gather gifts and compliments from the ruler.

606
02:40:15,984 --> 02:40:23,693
Let them cheer Your name out loud. After all, child, you could have been my son. Let them cheer.

607
02:40:29,161 --> 02:40:30,702
Salutations, my guru.
